# **Nobaros Cafe**
## **Synopsis**
After people die on earth, their spirits typically get sent to Nobaros Cafe, which is run by a guy named Ingram. His job is to act as a spirit guide and give them a final happy memory before they pass onto Heaven. The game mainly follows a girl named Emi, who appears in Nobaros with no memory whatsoever. As she spends time in the world of Nobaros trying to regain her memories, she'll get a chance to bond with a few other characters and learn about their own stories (thus the otome part of the game).
