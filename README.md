# **Nobaros Cafe**
## **Synopsis**
After people die on earth, their spirits typically get sent to Nobaros Cafe, which is run by a guy named Ingram. His job is to act as a spirit guide and give them a final happy memory before they pass onto Heaven. The game mainly follows a girl named Emi, who appears in Nobaros with no memory whatsoever. As she spends time in the world of Nobaros trying to regain her memories, she'll get a chance to bond with a few other characters and learn about their own stories.

## **Vision for the Game**
The story is infuenced by the notion of realizing that everybody has a story of their own and reflects the beauty of human relationships. While the romance might make the game seem like a stereotypical otome game, some messages regarding the brilliance/transience of life & death will be incorporated to (hopefully) bring the reader on an emotional, insightful journey as they play the game.

 The goal is to have a game that **isn't** super speedrunnable/skimmable. While it's true that a story can be both short and moving, it's just not something that Nobaros Cafe would be. It would be a slow burn story, especially when it comes to character development because people don't change overnight. The character routes in Norn9 would be a good example of how long Nobaros Cafe would (ideally) be.

 While there aren't any ***concrete*** plans to monetize the game, it would be nice to keep the option open so please keep this in mind when working on the game. As for where it will be released, putting it on Steam is the end goal (for now).

## **Collaboration & References**
A [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DMZjjJ9PHH) has been created for development purposes. Please use it to discuss ideas with each other & compile any reference pictures that may be helpful. Some sort of folder structure may be incorporated in the future to have all reference pics in one place.

## **World Building**
Please refer to the [Nobaros Almanac](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17t3-TSdAj4UgwCFj4FQ1D7YIE8SxQa3FcSxBkNIUY0M/edit?usp=sharing) for more details on the world of Nobaros. This doc aims to explain the way things work in Nobaros, cover game-specific terms & help conceptualize ideas for background art.

## **Story Writing**
The story is being handled in
[Nobaros Cafe Story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LNDB94zzsSvtDuwiQyZawUuIH6bBriXH-rDRsJvFDlk/edit?usp=sharing). This is different from the scriptwriting process, where all the dialogue lines and choices will be written. The scriptwriting will come ***after*** the story events have been finalized.

## **Character Profiles**
To learn more about the main characters, please refer to the [Character Bible](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Xra6ITBQN--jiYFyHQTVmmb9CMRA-vxKx1VYOvFpm0/edit?usp=sharing). For now, the profiles act as a guide for storywriting and a place to dump ideas which will be handy when storywriting, voice acting & creating character designs. In the future, this will be reworked to reflect actual character profiles for the game.
