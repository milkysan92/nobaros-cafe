# **Nobaros Cafe**
## **Synopsis**
After people die on earth, their spirits typically get sent to Nobaros Cafe, which is run by a guy named Ingram. His job is to act as a spirit guide and give them a final happy memory before they pass onto Heaven. The game mainly follows a girl named Emi, who appears in Nobaros with no memory whatsoever. As she spends time in the world of Nobaros trying to regain her memories, she'll get a chance to bond with a few other characters and learn about their own stories.

## **Vision for the Game**
The story is influenced by the idea that everybody has a story of their own and reflects the beauty of human relationships. While the romance might make the game seem like a stereotypical otome game, some messages regarding the brilliance/transience of life & death will be incorporated to (hopefully) bring the reader on an emotional, insightful journey as they play the game.

 This game is going to be quite big in scale, aiming for roughly 5+ hours of gameplay per route (3 romanceable, 1 platonic). The game, "Norn9: var Commons" would be a ideal example of how long Nobaros Cafe would be. There are also plans for a DLC expansion later down the road, with minigames and extra stories people can enjoy.

 If possible, I'd like to monetize the game down the road. No concrete plans have been made on how that will be done, but the ultimate goal is to release the game on Steam. This passion project is like my baby, so I have high expectations and ambitions when it comes to game quality. Please keep this in mind when working on the game.

 There's a [game development roadmap](https://github.com/milkysan92/nobaros-cafe/blob/main/script/Nobaros%20Cafe/Game%20development%20roadmap.md) that outlines what should be accomplished at each stage. This may be updated as development goes on.

## **Collaboration & References**
A [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DMZjjJ9PHH) has been created for development purposes. Please use it to discuss ideas with each other & put together any references that may be helpful. Some sort of folder structure may be incorporated in the future to have all reference pics in one place.

## **World Building**
Please refer to the [Nobaros Almanac](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17t3-TSdAj4UgwCFj4FQ1D7YIE8SxQa3FcSxBkNIUY0M/edit?usp=sharing) for more details on the world of Nobaros. This doc aims to explain the way things work in Nobaros, cover game-specific terms & help conceptualize ideas for background art.

## **Story Writing**
The storyboard draft can be found in
[Nobaros Cafe Story](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LNDB94zzsSvtDuwiQyZawUuIH6bBriXH-rDRsJvFDlk/edit?usp=sharing). This doc outlines all of the events that take place in the story, including player choices and endings. Some events may be changed or adjusted as I write the actual script, but largely should reflect what happens in the story.

The actual script with dialogue lines is written in markdown files using Obsidian. These markdown files are the most accurate version of the dialogue, but does not contain RenPy logic (ex: which sprite shows up on screen). Please refer to these markdown files when to ensure the RenPy script files (files that end in .rpy) match up with them.

There are also flowcharts that reflect the scenario sequence for each chapter. These files are named "Chapter ___ Master.md". Please refer to them to see how a scenario fits into the chapter/game.

## **Character Profiles**
To learn more about the characters, please refer to the [Character Bible](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15Xra6ITBQN--jiYFyHQTVmmb9CMRA-vxKx1VYOvFpm0/edit?usp=sharing). For now, the profiles act as a guide for storywriting and a place to dump ideas which will be handy when storywriting, voice acting & creating character designs. In the future, this will be reworked to reflect actual character profiles for the game.
