    emi "Let's sweep the foyer!"
    narrator "I grab the broom leaning against the corner and head out to the floor, collecting the day's accumulation of dust and dirt. Starting at each table, I create small piles, nudging them towards a corner where a larger pile awaits."
    narrator "As I sweep under the final table, a glint of light catches my eye. Intrigued, I crouch down and inspect the dust pile more closely."
    narrator "To my surprise, I find a small golden charm in the shape of a camellia flower. The charm is intricately detailed, with delicately sculpted petals that seem as though they could be damaged by the lightest touch. Etched on the back of the flower is the number eight."
