# Emi enters the cafe, exploring the room and not initially noticing Annelise buried in a pile of books. As Emi is walking around, she almost trips over Annelise, who is quietly reading.

    # Emi almost trips over Annelise, who is quietly reading in a corner.

    emi "Oh, sorry! I didn't see you there. Are you okay?"

    annelise "Oh, um, yes, I'm fine. I was just... lost in my books."

    emi "No worries! I'm Emi, by the way. I'm here to help out with cleaning. Ingram asked me."

    annelise "Cleaning? Oh, I didn't realize anyone else would be here today."

    emi "Surprise visit, I guess. You seem deep into your reading. What are you working on?"

    annelise "Ah it's.. just some books I enjoy. I come here to read sometimes."

    emi "(noticing Annelise's shyness) That's cool! Well, I'll get to the cleaning, and you can enjoy your books. Nice to meet you, Annelise!"

    # As Emi starts cleaning, she realizes Annelise is more reserved. The conversation shifts when Annelise learns Emi is a friend of Ingram's.

    emi "By the way, Ingram and I are pretty friendly. He thought I could pitch in, you know, lend a hand."

    annelise "Ingram? Really? You're a friend of his?"

    emi "Yep! He's a great guy. That's how I ended up here. Are you close with Ingram too?"

    annelise "Well, yeah. He's, um, a good friend. Any friend of Ingram's is a friend of mine."

    emi "Great! I'll handle the cleaning, and you can enjoy your reading. Nice to officially meet you, Annelise!"

    # Annelise relaxes, feeling more comfortable with Emi, and the two continue their tasks in the cozy atmosphere of the cafe.
