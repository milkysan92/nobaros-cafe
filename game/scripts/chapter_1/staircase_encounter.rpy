# Late at night, Emi is heading upstairs to her room, while Akira is going downstairs for a glass of water. They cross paths in the hallway.

label staircase_encounter:
    emi "(noticing Akira) Oh, hi! I'm just heading up. Are you also on a midnight snack mission?"

    akira "(surprised, but composed) Ah, no. Just getting some water. I find it helps me think. You?"

    emi "(smiles) Water's a great companion for late-night thoughts. But I was actually just calling it a night. Tomorrow's a big day."

    akira "(nodding) Indeed, tomorrow is important for many reasons. What brings you here?"

    emi "(blushing slightly, mentally slapping herself) Well, the stairs did. But really, just winding down after a day of adventures. And you?"

    akira "(raising an eyebrow) Adventures at this hour?"

    # TODO: Adjust this dialogue to talk about working at the cafe and helping Ingram with spiritguiding
    emi " (laughs nervously) Maybe more like mental adventures. Thoughts and ideas, you know?"

    akira "(smirks) A fellow night owl. Interesting."

    emi "(Oh wow, he has a really nice smile. Okay, Emi, focus!)"

    emi "By the way, I'm Emi. It's nice to meet you!"

    akira "Akira Higashi. Pleasure to meet you too."

    emi "(shaking hands, still flustered) Likewise! Anyway, I should get going. It was nice bumping into you. Sleep well, or, you know, have profound thoughts with your water."

    akira "(smirking) I'll do my best. Goodnight, Emi."

    emi "(heading upstairs, still flustered) Smooth, Emi, real smooth."
