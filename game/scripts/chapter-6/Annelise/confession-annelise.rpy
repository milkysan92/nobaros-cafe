# Soft candlelight bathes the room, casting a warm and intimate ambiance. Kai walks in, discovering Annelise lost in contemplation on the plush couch.

Kai "(softly) Annelise, why are you still up?"

# Annelise looks up, her eyes reflecting a genuine concern that goes beyond words.

Annelise "(softly) I couldn't sleep. I was worried about you, Kai."

# Kai sits beside her, appreciating the tenderness in her gaze.

Annelise "So is your mom...?"

# Kai nods, silently confirming Annelise's words. He lets out a heavy sigh, burying his head in his hands.

Kai "(sighs) My thoughts are tangled, it's a total mess. I can't even make sense of anything."

Kai "It just all feels so surreal... and overwhelming."

# Annelise senses his distress, enveloping him in a gentle embrace, providing a silent haven.

Annelise "(hugging him) Let it out, Kai. I'm right here."

# Kai leans into her warmth, finding solace in her caring embrace.

Annelise "(revealing a secret) You know, actually I was waiting for you to come home. I wanted to give you something."

# Annelise delicately unveils a portrait of Kai's late mom. Kai's eyes well up with emotion.

Kai "(teary-eyed) Annelise, this means the world to me. Thank you."

# Annelise tightens her embrace, and Kai, overwhelmed, buries his head in her shoulder, grateful for her comforting presence.

Annelise "(nervously) There's something else I've been meaning to tell you."

# Kai looks at her with curiosity, and Annelise takes a deep breath.

Annelise "(smiling) I... I really like you, Kai."

Annelise "A lot more than you might think."

Annelise "At first I thought I admired you, because you're always so energetic and people are just naturally drawn to you."

Annelise "I wanted to become confident in myself, just as how you're unapologetically yourself."

Annelise "And then the next thing I knew... "

Annelise "These feelings grew into something more. I found myself always wanting to be by your side."

Annelise "Just like how a growing flower flourishes under the sun..."

Annelise "I-I guess I'm just saying...you're my sun."

# Annelise turns beet red, realizing how cheesy she sounds in the last sentence.
# Kai blushes, his ears turning a shade of gentle rose. He cups his face, as if trying to hide his red face.

Kai "(softly) That's not right..."

# Confusion clouds Annelise's face, but Kai, with a gentle laugh, touches his neck.

Kai "(smiling) I meant to tell you first, but it seems like you beat me to it."

# Annelise's eyes light up with hope.

Annelise "(excitedly) Then-! You mean...?"

# Kai opens his arms, confessing his feelings with sincerity.

Kai "(smiles) I feel the same way. I'm in love with you, Annelise."

# Overwhelmed with joy, Annelise rushes into his embrace, accepting his gesture. They hug tightly, foreheads touching, immersed in a moment of sweet relief and burgeoning romance.

Annelise "(laughing) My heart is racing so hard, I've never felt like this before."

Kai "(chuckling) I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel the same. But that just makes you cuter."

# Kai briefly draws apart from Annelise, placing his lips on her forehead for a tender kiss.
# The kiss is brief and Kai draws away all too quickly. Annelise feels a hot sensation where Kai's lips were, secretly wishing it was longer.
# They look at each other again and share a soft laugh, their connection deepening as they savor the sweetness of the moment.

Annelise "(teasingly) I guess we both took a detour on the way to confessing, didn't we?"

Kai "(smiling) But I wouldn't have it any other way. It's just how we are, unique and perfect in our own way."

# They hold each other a little tighter, lost in the comfort of newfound love, as the gentle flicker of candlelight illuminates their shared journey ahead.
