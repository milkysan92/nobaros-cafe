    # Emi cautiously enters Ingram's room, observing the minimalist and homely atmosphere that mirrors his personality.

    # Ingram, somewhat nervous, shares a rare vulnerability.

    ingram "This is the first time I've shown my room to anyone."

    # Emi, touched by his openness, smiles warmly.

    emi "I feel honored, Ingram. You're not as private as you think."

    # They compare hands, and Emi notices the roughness of Ingram's from his hard work.

    emi "(teasingly) You know, you look pretty good usually, but I think you look even better when we hold hands."

    # Ingram bursts into laughter, surprised by Emi's boldness.

    ingram "(laughing) Where did you learn to say such things?"

    emi "(teasing) Oh, just came up with it. I wanted to see how you'd react."

    # They continue chatting as Ingram hugs Emi from behind, their hands intertwined.

    emi "(softly) It's so peaceful here at night."

    ingram "Mm."

    # Ingram, overwhelmed by feelings, places his head on Emi's shoulder.

    emi "(smiling) You've become quite touchy, haven't you?"

    # Ingram, opening up, explains his desire to convey his feelings through actions.

    ingram "Well, actions speak louder than words. I want you to know how much I treasure you."

    # Emi pats his head affectionately.

    emi "You're doing a good job."

    # Ingram cups Emi's cheek, a silent request for a kiss. Emi closes her eyes, and they share a tender kiss.

    ingram "...not enough."

    emi "Huh?"

    ingram "It's not enough. This isn't enough to show you my feelings."

    # Ingram, feeling the intensity, transitions to nibbling on Emi's neck, leaving love bites.

    emi "(squirming) Ingram, you're being so bold tonight."

    # Breaking apart, they catch their breath.

    ingram "I feel so warm because of you. It's your fault for making me feel this way."

    ingram "Won't you help me?"

    # Ingram slyly asks for Emi's help, and she, blushing, turns around on her knees, meeting his half-lidded eyes.

    emi "(intrigued) What do you need?"

    # They kiss again, and Ingram slides a hand under Emi's dress.

    emi "(shivering) Your touch..."

    # As the night unfolds, boundaries blur, and their connection deepens.

    emi "(whispering) I love you."

    ingram "I love you too."

    # Ingram reciprocates, sealing their bond in the intimate space they've created together.
