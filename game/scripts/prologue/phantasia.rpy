    narrator "So many questions came to mind, but no answers accompanied them."
    
    narrator "I could barely get my bearings together."
    
    narrator "My head felt heavy, and I was awfully disoriented."
    
    narrator "Yet my body felt as light as a feather."
    
    narrator "It was almost as if I was dreaming."
    
    narrator "With a bit of effort, I fought the disoriented feeling and got up onto my feet."
    
    unknown_e "(Ugh, why do I feel so groggy?)"
    
    unknown_e "(Maybe some deep breaths will help. . .)"
    
    unknown_e "(In. . . and out.)"
    
    narrator "Fresh, crisp air found its way into my lungs, giving me goosebumps."
    
    narrator "As I took one deep breath after another, I could feel myself slowly getting accustomed to reality."
    
    narrator "My eyes were starting to adjust to the surroundings too."
    
    narrator "Colourful blurs that flooded my field of vision transformed into clearly defined objects."
    
    narrator "A field of grass at my feet, and a long strand of clouds that stretched far out into the sky."
    
    narrator "I had to admit, it was a pretty sight to see."
    
    narrator "I couldn't help but feel revitalized at such a scene."
    
    unknown_e "(Alright then. So how did I get here?)"
    
    narrator "I quickly scanned my surroundings, looking to see if anybody else was around."
    
    unknown_e "Hmm, not a living soul in sight. Looks like I'm alone."
    
    unknown_e "(So that rules out someone bringing me here. . .)"
    
    unknown_e "(Nothing in this place seems familiar to me.)"
    
    unknown_e "(My memories. . . it's a total blank slate.)"
    
    unknown_e "(Ugh, if only I could remember something. It's as if my head's being blocked by something.)"
    
    narrator "No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't recall a single thing."
    
    narrator "I was getting a bit frustrated."
    
    narrator "Just then, a gentle breeze interrupted my thoughts."
    
    narrator "I couldn't help but notice some slight hints of a sweet, earthy scent."
    
    unknown_e "Oh, that smells nice. Where is it coming from?"
    
    narrator "I walked towards the scent, which got stronger the more I walked."
    
    narrator "I was curious to see if the scent might tell me anything about my situation."
    
    narrator "Eventually, I found myself at a glistening lake with patches of healthy irises sprinkled here and there."
    
    unknown_e "(Ah, so that's what smelled so sweet. . .)"
    
    narrator "I approached the lake, wanting to take a closer look."
    
    narrator "As I peered over the edge of the water, I stared at my own reflection."
