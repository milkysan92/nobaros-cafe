    narrator "Kai bursts into laughter, clearly amused by his prank."
    kai "Gotcha, Emi! Sorry, I couldn't resist."
    narrator "Turning to face him, I try to hide my surprise with a glare."
    emi "Kai, you scared me!"
    kai "Aw, come on, it was just a little joke. Here, let me make it up to you."
    narrator "He wipes a tear from his eye. After composing himself, he picks up the bag of macarons and hands them to me with a sheepish smile."
    emi "It isn't very nice to scare someone who went through the trouble of finding food for you."
    kai "You're right. I promise I'll behave."
    kai "So what did you end up finding?"
    narrator "With a huff, I push the bag of macarons into his arms."
    emi "There were some leftover macarons. It probably won't fill you up too much but it was what we had."
    narrator "Kai tugs at the bag, peering inside to inspect the macarons. His eyes shine brightly at the sight of them."
    kai "Oh sweet! I'll never turn these down, they're my favourite! I've been craving them these days too."
    emi "I'm glad to hear that you have something nice to eat. Just remember that macarons aren't a good substitute for a meal, so you should eat a proper meal when you can."
    kai "Don't worry, I'll make sure to eat a big meal when I get home later."
    narrator "Kai laughs as he grabs one of the macarons and take a bite, dancing in excitement. I laugh along with him at how happy he is over a small treat."
    narrator "He eagerly gobbles down, delighting in each bite with animated reactions."
    narrator "In a matter of minutes, he empties the bag and looks almost sad that there aren't any more."
    kai "Ahh, that felt so good!"
    kai "Thanks a lot Emi, that really hit the spot."
    emi "Wow, you really devoured that bag. I'm surprised you didn't choke on a crumb or something!"
    narrator "Kai laughs heartily, a proud glint in his eyes."
    kai "What can I say? I like sweets. If you put some in front of me, I guarantee they'll disappear right under your nose."
    emi "(I guess that's one thing we have in common.)"
    kai "Alright, now that I've gotten a bite to eat, I'm gonna head out now."
    kai "It was nice finally meeting you, I'll see you later Emi!"
    narrator "Kai excitedly waves as he leaves the cafe, the door chime tinkling behind his departure."
