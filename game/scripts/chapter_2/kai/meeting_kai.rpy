    emi talk "Let's sweep the foyer!"
    narrator base "I grab the broom leaning against the corner and head out to the foyer."

    scene cafe with bgwipe
    narrator base "Starting at each table, I create small piles, nudging them towards a corner where a larger pile awaits. Slowly but surely, the day's accumulation of dust and dirt start to disappear."
    narrator "As I sweep under the final table, a glint of light catches my eye. Intrigued, I crouch down and inspect the dust pile more closely."
    narrator "To my surprise, I find a small golden charm in the shape of a camellia flower."
    narrator "The charm is intricately detailed, with delicately sculpted petals that seem as though they could be damaged by the lightest touch. {w=0.1}Etched on the back of the flower is the number eight."
    emi talk "What a pretty charm! I wonder where it came from. . . maybe someone's necklace or something?"
    narrator base "Deciding to keep the charm in case the owner returns, I tuck it into a small apron pocket and continue sweeping the foyer."
    narrator "After collecting the dust into a dustpan and disposing of it in a nearby trashcan, I feel a sense of accomplishment."
    narrator "Setting the broom aside momentarily, I head to the counter to wash my hands."
    narrator "Just as I'm about to finish up, the front door bursts open and a blaring voice shatters my eardrums."
    uk_kai "INGRAM!! ARE YOU IN HERE?!" with vpunch
    narrator "I shoot my eyes towards the cafe entrance."
    narrator "A guy around my age stands right at the doorway, panting heavily as if he had been sprinting just before arriving, his jacket barely clinging to his shoulders."
    narrator "Out of the corner of my eye, I see Ingram in the middle of preparing some espresso shots at the coffee grinder, still unaware that the front door had swung right open."
    narrator "In his stead, I quickly pat my hands dry with a nearby towel and approach the disheveled guy to see what the ruckus is."

    emi talk "Sorry, Ingram is busy at the moment. Can I help you with something?"
    narrator base "The guy looks at me desperately and claps his hands together, as if he's about to pray."
    uk_kai "Oh. thank god you're here! I lost something and I think it might be somewhere around here."
    emi talk "What did you lose? Maybe I can help you find it."
    uk_kai base "It's kinda like a small golden thing. It should look like a flower of some kind."
    emi talk "Wait a minute, could you be talking about this?"
    narrator base "I dig into my apron pocket and fish out the golden camellia charm I found earlier."
    narrator "As I lay it in my palm and show it to him, his eyes light up, and he nods excitedly."
    uk_kai "That's the one! Thanks a bunch!"
    narrator "I offer the charm to him, which he graciously receives with both hands."
    uk_kai "By the way, are you new around here? Ingram doesn't usually work with anyone in the cafe."
    uk_kai "Actually, I don't think I've ever seen Ingram working with {i}anyone{/i} in general. . ."
    uk_kai "But never mind that! Let me introduce myself. My name's Kai, what's yours?"
    emi talk "Oh, right, I'm Emi! I'm helping Ingram out with both the cafe and with spirit guiding."
    kai base "Wait, {w=0.3}Emi? {w=0.3}I think I know you!"
    kai "Ingram was mentioning that we'd be getting a new roommate at Yuugen House!"
    emi talk "I guess news spreads fast around here, huh?"
    kai base "Oh, it's nothing like that. Ingram just decided to gather everyone and tell us all at once." 
    kai "I was beginning to wonder when I'd get to meet you!"
    emi "(Huh, I didn't expect anybody to be so excited about a new roommate.)"
    emi "(What's with him? It's not like I'm some fairy goddess that descended or something. . .)"
    emi "(That being said, I wonder what a guy like him is doing with a camellia charm in the first place.)"
    emi "(It doesn't really fit his. . . style?)"
    emi talk "By the way, how did you lose the charm? {w=0.1}Was it from a piece of jewelry or something?"
    kai base "Oh right, let me show you!"
    narrator "Kai rolls up his left sleeve, revealing a jade bracelet wrapped around his slender wrist."
    narrator "He shifts his hand, revealing a small section of gold that connects one end of the bracelet to the other. {w=0.1}With a brief motion, he reattaches the camellia charm, making a distinct clink while doing so."
    kai "The charm is a part of this bracelet! It's been with me ever since I came here. I don't really know why, but I feel weirdly empty taking it off so I just keep it on me at all times."
    kai "See this engraving on the back? The number eight is associated with good fortune, so I see it as a lucky token of some sorts! When I found out the charm went missing, I really panicked."
    kai "I guess I really lucked out, since it's easy to miss such a small charm. I'm glad it was safe in your hands of all places. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do if it was gone for good."
    narrator "Kai flashes a wide grin at me, which I warmly reciprocate. Seeing him so cheerful after getting the charm back makes me feel happy for him."
    narrator "The bracelet must mean a lot to him."
    emi "(His energy is contagious. . . my mood's improving just from talking to him.)"
    kai "So I'm curious. How are you faring so far? Have you managed to regain any memories yet?"
    kai "How about the spirit guiding stuff? Did you-"
    narrator "Kai begins barraging me with questions, getting closer as he asks each one. He's talking at lightning speed, making it hard to comprehend what he's trying to ask."
    narrator "Before I manage to respond, a low, rumbling sound cuts Kai's questions off."
    narrator "The two of us stare at each other in silence, confused."
    emi ". . ."
    kai ". . ."
    emi talk ". . .Was that you?"
    kai base "No way, I don't know what you're talking about. That's gotta be you."
    emi talk "But I just ate lunch a few hours ago! I think I'd know if it was my own stomach."
    narrator base "Just then, another growl rumbles. This time, it's clearly coming from Kai."
    kai ". . ."
    kai "Do. {w}Not. {w}Say. {w}A. {w}Thing."
    emi talk ". . . I-"
    kai base "AHHHHHHHHH!!"
    narrator "I barely open my mouth before Kai waves his hands frantically, trying to stop me from talking. I could see his entire face turning beet red, spreading from his cheeks to the tips of his ears."
    kai "Okay okay, you've got me."
    kai "So I may or may not have skipped lunch 'cause I was looking for my charm all afternoon. . ."
    emi talk "You haven't eaten yet?!"
    narrator base "Kai shakes his head, his hand pitifully cradling his gurgling stomach."
    emi "(I feel bad for him. . . he almost looks like a sad puppy.)"
    emi talk "Okay, hold on, I have an idea. I can go find something for you to eat from behind the counter."
    kai base "Wait, wait, stealing food is a crime! There's no need for you to go to such lengths for me."
    emi talk "What? No, you've got it all wrong, I'm not gonna steal from the display case."
    emi "Sometimes, we have stuff that doesn't turn out well and can't be sold to customers."
    emi base "(I don't have the heart to tell him that half of the ugly desserts were made by me, as a result of Ingram's pastry making sessions.)"
    emi "(But he doesn't have to know that.)"
    kai "Ohhh, that makes sense. If that's the case, then I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands!"
    emi talk "Okay, just wait here then. I'll have a look at what we have."
