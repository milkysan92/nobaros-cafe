    emi "Ingram, I'm curious about something."
    ingram "Of course, what's on your mind?"
    emi "I was just wondering. . .is there nobody else working here? Is it really just you taking on everything?"
    ingram "Yes, that's right."
    emi "Don't you ever get tired or burned out?"
    emi "Earlier, you said it comes down to finding the right rhythm or being organized. . ."
    emi "But at some point, there has to be a limit, no?"
    narrator "Ingram shakes his head, his gaze shifting slightly."
    ingram "It's one of the perks of being a spirit guide."
    ingram "You see, my constitution is a bit different than yours."
    ingram "As you've seen so far, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with spirit guiding, especially since it's on a regular basis."
    ingram "My powers allow me to be able to keep up with everything."
    emi "Does that mean you never get tired then?"
    ingram "Well, think of it this way. It still requires effort to get all these tasks done, but in completing them, I don't expend as much energy as a regular person would."
    ingram "So with that being said, it's not often that I get that tired."
    emi "I guess I can understand that, but that still leaves the question of why there's no other workers here. You've never thought about enlisting someone to divide up the work?"
    narrator "He sets down his cloth, leaning casually against the counter. There's a contemplative look on his face, as if weighing his words carefully."
    ingram ". . .I could never choose to burden someone with that responsibilty."
    ingram "People don't come to Nobaros of their own accord. Why would they want to work while they're here?"
    ingram "Not that I'd reject the help if it's offered, but it doesn't sit well with me to reach out and force these responsibilities on someone else."
    ingram "That's why I was surprised when you told me you wanted to help out."
    ingram "You're the first one to ever ask ."
    narrator "Ingram looks at me with a steady gaze, his voice devoid of any doubt."
    narrator "His sincerity invokes a wave of emotions within me. It's disheartening that no one ever thought to offer some help around the cafe."
    narrator "Although it's weird to think considering the circumstances, I'm grateful to be here."
    emi "(Hopefully, I can start getting the hang of things quickly. The more I can take on, the less tasks he'll have to deal with.)"
