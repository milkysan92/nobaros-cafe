# TODO: Taken from chatGPT; needs polishing
# (The group has decided to cook a dinner to welcome Emi, the newest member of Yuugen house.)

    ingram "Hey everyone, let's make sure we create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for our new friend. Emi, are you craving anything in particular?"

    emi "Oh no, I'm not picky at all! I love trying new things. Surprise me!"

    annelise "I can take care of the aesthetics! I can set up the table and maybe get some flowers to freshen it up? It'd be nice if the table looked as good as the food."

    # Kai raised his hand to volunteer in the dinner efforts.

    kai "I can help out with the cooking!"
    
    kai "It's all about the flavors! What if we make a variety of dishes? Something spicy, savory, and we've obviously got to have something sweet at the end! It'll be a taste adventure!"

    akira "Now now, even if it's a celebratory dinner, we should keep things under control. We can't be making a huge mess in the kitchen."

    akira "I'll take a look and see what ingredients we've got. Let's stick to a schedule to get everything done on time."

    akira "Let's see... approximately how long would it take to cook everything...?"

    kai "Aw come on, Akira! Can't we just enjoy the process? It's about the journey, not just the destination."

    ingram "While that might be true, enjoyment is subjective to everyone."

    ingram "I think Akira has a point. A well-organized plan ensures a clean kitchen, and I definitely enjoy having less cleaning to do."

    kai "Sure, Mr. Efficiency. But sometimes, the best plans are the ones you stumble upon."

    # Everyone bickers about what to make as Akira looks through the pantry for ingredients. Eventually, the group settles on something to make and the cooking commences. Ingram decides to step out once it looks like things are in order.

    ingram "Well, you guys, I've got to take care of a few things. But you're in good hands. Enjoy the dinner and make our new friend feel at home."

    # Ingram leaves the group to handle other tasks, feeling a bit awkward and not entirely part of the group dynamic.

    emi "Huh? Where did Ingram go? We should invite him to join us for dinner."

    annelise "Oh, you're right! He just disappeared right under our noses."

    annelise "I agree, let's make sure everyone feels included."

    # Cut to Emi finding Ingram in the living room

    emi "Hey Ingram, where did you disappear to? We're getting everything ready for dinner."

    ingram "*smiles* Oh, you know me, always caught up in the details. I thought it would be best if I took care of a few things behind the scenes."

    emi "But we're a team! You're the one who suggested this whole dinner idea. You should be part of it."

    ingram " (looking a bit reserved) I appreciate that, Emi. I just thought I could contribute better by handling some things from the background. You guys have a pretty good workflow going."

    emi "Come on, Ingram! We're here to have fun and make everyone feel welcome, including you. Your input is valuable, and I want you with us."

    ingram " (nods slightly) I'm not as comfortable in these situations. I just wanted to make sure everything runs smoothly for you and the group."

    emi "Your unique touch is what makes everything special. We're all in this together. Now, come on, join us in the chaos!"

    ingram "(smiles softly) Alright, I can't say no if you insist. Let's go and have a nice dinner."
