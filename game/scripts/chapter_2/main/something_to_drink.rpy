    narrator "I look through the shelves of the fridge, finding a jug of water, a milk bottle and a pitcher containing tea."
    emi "(Milk is definitely the classic choice to make, but the bottle is nearly empty. I kind of feel bad about leaving only a bit left.)"
    emi "(Alternatively, tea might be pretty refreshing, but I'm not sure what kind of tea this is. It'd be nice if it was sweet, but I don't really want to drink it if it's unsweetened. . .)"
    emi "(Considering that it's almost bedtime, I could just give my stomach a break and drink some water. It can't hurt to hydrate myself some more.)"
