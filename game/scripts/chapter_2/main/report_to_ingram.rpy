    narrator base "The cafe is bathed in a soft, golden glow, casting long shadows that dance across the floor. With only a few lingering customers left, an intimate sense of tranquility envelops the space."
    narrator "As I return to the counter, I notice Ingram standing there with a cloth in hand. Although he appears to be looking at the customers, his gaze is distant, as though he's staring at something far beyond the cafe walls."
    emi "(That's rare, I thought he would've been in the middle of preparing drinks.)"
    emi "(But I guess it is getting late. Thankfully, there isn't as many people now, compared to this morning.)"

    emi talk "Ingram, I'm back!"
    narrator base "My voice breaks his trance, drawing his previously distant eyes to focus on me. His expression shifts, a small smile playing on his lips as he turns to face my direction."
    ingram "Welcome back. I take it that everything went smoothly?"
    emi talk "Yep! I managed to finish everything without a hitch."
    ingram base "That's good to hear, thanks for handling it."
    emi talk "How was everything on your end? Were there any more rushes like earlier?"
    ingram base "It was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary, which I'd consider to be a good thing."
    narrator "Ingram looks back at the floor, a satisfied look on his face."
    emi "(Now that I think about it, why isn't there anybody else working here?)"
    emi "(Managing this entire place alone must be a huge weight on Ingram's shoulders.)"
    emi "(So why doesn't he get more people to divide up the work?)"
    emi "(. . .I'm kind of curious.)"
    emi "(Should I ask him?)"
    emi "(Oh, but I should also let him know about how I ran into Kai, Akira and Annelise earlier. )"
