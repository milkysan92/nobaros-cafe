    ingram "It's a pleasure to meet you. May I know how I should refer to you?"

    ingram "Well then Izumi, do you remember anything? Either about yourself or what you were doing just before this?"
    izumi "Yes, I was in my room not that long ago. I still remember it clearly."
    izumi "I was just about to head to bed, but then I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my chest and had trouble breathing. Within minutes, I lost my strength and passed out."
    izumi "For a brief moment, everything felt cold and still. All the thoughts in my head completely disappeared, and I just felt absolute nothingness."
    narrator "Izumi clutches his chest, the memory of his heart attack still vivid."
    izumi "When I regained consciousness, I found myself here."
    emi "(Hmm, so he does remember what happened to him. That rules out the possiblity of him being a vagabond.)"
    emi "(So that means he's actually. . .)"
    emi "(What a surprise, he's so young too. Is he in his twenties maybe? There's no way he's older than thirty at most.)"
    izumi "So you said this is the realm between life and death. . .? I'm not in the afterlife just yet?"
    ingram "No, you're here because there are unresolved matters from your life."
    ingram "As a spirit guide, I'll be helping you through the process of fulfilling one last joy before you move on."
    ingram "But first, would you like something to drink? It may help to calm your mind and sort your feelings out as we chat."
    narrator "Ingram presents the special drink menu to him, offering a selection of beverages to choose from."
    ingram "You can select any of the drinks on this menu here."
    izumi ". . .I see. Thank you, I'll take some sencha tea please."

    narrator "As he pours a cup for Izumi, hot steam emanates from the flowing stream, dissipating into the air with each passing moment."
    narrator "As Izumi sips his tea, the tension in his shoulders disappears and his body deflates with a satisfied look."
    narrator "Ingram starts explaining the spirit guiding process, while Izumi listens attentively, nodding every so often."

    narrator "Izumi laughs, reminiscing his youth."
    izumi "I started picking up photography to pass the time. At first, it was just borrowing my dad's camera to take pictures of the cicadas during the summer."

    emi "Oh wow, that's amazing! Did you ever publish your photos at an exhibition of some sorts?"

    izumi "I was hesitant at first, but after some encouragement from my sister, I decided to let her post my photos."
    izumi "The blog ended up attracting a lot of attention, and people left really nice comments about how much they liked my photos. So after that, I continued to snap photos for her to post."

    izumi "She was always supportive of me. Even after she moved out and got married, she kept the photography blog going."
    narrator "A warm smile carves itself on Izumi's lips as he reminisces about his sister."

    izumi "I definitely have photos that I'm proud of, but there was something missing from all of them."
    emi "What was missing? Was there a certain feeling or subject you were aiming for?"
    narrator "Izumi shakes his head, staring down at his lap without an answer."
    narrator "Judging from the melancholy in his expression, the idea of creating his magnum opus must've weighed heavily on him."
    izumi "Unfortunately, I'm not actually sure what that 'something' is."
    izumi "I'm just not satisfied with the photos I've taken to date."
    narrator "Izumi looks right at me and Ingram, his eyes carrying a determined glint that speaks of both regret and hope."
    izumi "This must be what Ingram was referring to earlier about an unresolved matter from my life."
    izumi "So if you guys are supposed to help me before I go. . .I'll definitely take this as another chance to create the photo I've been striving for."
    ingram "I see, I admire your determination."
    ingram "I'm sure once you find that missing puzzle piece, that perfectionist side of you won't burden you anymore."

    ingram "Thank you for sharing about your life with us. We'll definitely do our best to help you."
    narrator "Ingram rises from his chair and walks over to Izumi, extending his hand."
    narrator "Izumi accepts the gesture with a slight bow. A quiet understanding seems to form between the two, almost like an unspoken promise."
    ingram "Emi, can you start stacking the chairs on the tables? I don't think we'll receive any more customers, so we'll be closing up shop a bit earlier than usual."
