    narrator "Akira takes the vegetables to the sink and starts washing them, placing the cleaned ones in a colander."
    kai "Alright, Annelise, what do you wanna start with?"
    annelise "Hmm, let's cut the potatoes. I'll handle it!"
    narrator "Once Akira finishes cleaning the vegetables, Annelise drags the colander of cleaned vegetables over to a cutting board. Scurrying over to a kitchen drawer, she starts digging around for a knife."
    annelise "Hmm, where could it be. . ."
    kai "Annelise, are you looking for a knife? I've got one right he-"
    annelise "Ah, there it is!"
    kai "E-Eh?! Where'd you find that?!"
    narrator "Just as Kai is about to offer a knife to her, Annelise finds a big cleaver at the back of the drawer."
    narrator "With an awkwardly threatening grip, she begins to hack away at the potatoes, chopping them into uneven chunks with questionable technique."
    kai "A-Annelise, do you need some help with that?"
    annelise "What? I'm doing fine! See?"
    narrator "Annelise smiles as she swings the cleaver at another potato, sending a piece flying towards Kai at lightning speed."

    emi "(Still, I never would've imagined that they'd pull something like this for me. I didn't know what to expect from them as my roommates, but I'm happy to see that they're good people.)"
