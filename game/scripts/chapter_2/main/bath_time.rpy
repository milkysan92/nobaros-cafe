    emi "(I feel like I'm going to get a food coma anytime now. . .)"
    emi "(. . .No, I can't sleep just yet. I need to take a bath first.)"
    emi "(I think Ingram said there was a hot spring here for bathing. This is the perfect opportunity to check it out!)"

    emi "(Whoa, Ingram wasn't kidding! This place looks like it belongs in a full blown bathhouse!)"
    narrator "A generous amount of steam lingers above the surface of the water, only slivers of the bath visible from where I stand."
    narrator "From what I could make out, there are small rocks bordering the edges of the bath. I blindly follow the warm glow of the lanterns scattered around the floor, feeling around for the bath entrance."
    narrator "After a bit of careful treading, I come across a slight ramp descending into the water. With nothing but a towel in hand, I slowly slip in, immersing myself up to my shoulders."
    narrator "The water's temperature initially feels uncomfortable, bordering the limit of being too hot. But in the span of a few minutes, the harsh heat gradually melts into a gentle warmth that steeps into my muscles, releasing any tension in them."
    emi "(Ahh, that hits the spot! I could stay here forever. . .)"
    narrator "As I lean against the edge of the water, my mind wanders, reflecting on the day's events. From meeting the others to helping Izumi with his photography, this morning's lunch rush seems like a distant memory in comparison."
    emi "(Now that I think about it, today was really eventful. I met a lot of new faces, on top of working at the cafe and spirit guiding.)"
    emi "(It's weird to think that all that happened in one day.)"
    emi "(Kai, Annelise and Akira. . .they're really nice people. I'm glad I have them as roommates.)"
    narrator "My mind flashes to the scene of everyone working together in the kitchen. As I recall the potato mark left on Kai's forehead, I burst out laughing, feeling relieved that I could finally release the laughter I held in earlier."
    emi "(That really was ridiculous, I didn't know a potato could fly that fast in midair.)"
    emi "(It's my first time witnessing them all together at once, and yet, I already feel so welcome. I even got to see Ingram break out of his usual calm self.)"
    emi "(I wonder what it'd be like if I got to know them a little better. . .I guess only time will tell.)"
    narrator "I soak in the bath for a while longer, the relaxing sensation leaving me devoid of all thoughts."
    narrator "With how still everything around me is, it feels as if time has stopped for a brief moment. If it weren't for the ripples on the water's surface, I'd float away to dreamland within mere moments."

    emi "(Mmm but I'm kind of sleepy too. Maybe I should go up to my room and rest for the night?)"
