    narrator "He quickly packs up our lunches, and soon we're on our feet, eager to try something new for the photoshoot."

    narrator "I grow excited and prepare myself to run down the path, only to be stopped by Izumi's firm grip on my wrist."
    izumi "Sis, don't go running off. You know I can't take strenuous exercise. My heart won't be able to keep up."
    ch2_emi "Oh, that's right. Sorry, I got too excited for a second there."

    izumi "Ah, but you mentioned taking pictures of people for a change right? Who should we ask?"
    narrator "I scan the area, searching for someone who might be open to modelling."
    ch2_emi "(Hmm, technically, we could ask any one of these people here. But they all seem preoccupied in taking their own photos.)"
    izumi "Um, maybe I should just take more nature shots instead. I mean, people might not want to be bothered. . ."
    ch2_emi "(. . .He seems just as nervous as earlier. Maybe he's more anxious about this than I realized.)"
    ch2_emi "That's okay, we don't have to ask someone else if they're busy. How about I model for you instead?"
    ch2_emi "It'll be more comfortable, and you can direct me as much as you need!"

    ch2_emi "Got it! What kind of pose should I do? Do you want me to change it up every once in a while?"
    izumi "Hmm, you can do whatever feels natural to you. I don't think you need to think too hard about it."
    izumi "If you really can't think of anything, just look at me and smile."
    izumi "I'll figure something out."

    narrator "It takes Izumi a moment to find the right angles but eventually, he gets into the zone and shoots away."

    izumi ". . .Perhaps my skills just aren't there yet. Maybe I'm trying to capture something beyond my reach."
    ch2_emi "But you're an amazing photographer! You've been shooting for so long, and your pictures get a lot of attention on the blog!"
    izumi "Well, that doesn't mean that I've learned it all. There's always room for improvement."
    izumi "I guess I'm being too perfectionistic. I'll need to grow more as a photographer first. . ."
    narrator "Izumi's frustration is evident as he packs his camera. I watch him silently, trying to figure out how to comfort him."
