    ch2_emi "I think we should head to the waterfall after all. It'll show up well on camera, so I don't think you could ever go wrong there."

    izumi "Okay, if that's what you think. I'll follow you."
    narrator "He quickly packs up our lunches, and soon we're on our feet, eager to try something new for the photoshoot."

    ch2_emi ". . .Hey Izumi, can I ask you something?"
    izumi "Hmm? What's up?"
    ch2_emi "What usually goes through your mind when you're taking a photo? Is there a particular image or feeling you aim for?"
    izumi "What goes through my mind. . .?"
    izumi "Well, to be honest, I try not to overthink when I'm looking through the lens."
    izumi "But I do go in with the mindset of wanting to capture the beauty of the subject in front of me."
    ch2_emi "Oh, so you try to take the most beautiful shot possible then?"
    izumi "In a sense, yeah. But the subject itself doesn't have to be super unique or anything."
    izumi "It's more about appreciating the world around us. If you saw a tree branch, you wouldn't think much of it, right?"
    izumi "But that branch is the result of a tiny seed going through many ordeals to grow into a big tree. If you take that into consideration, then wouldn't it become more meaningful?"
    ch2_emi "When you put it that way, that's true. It's one of the small things we take for granted because it's all around us, right?"
    show izumi smile with faceswap
    izumi "Exactly. When I take a photo, I want people to feel something when they look at it. I want them to see the story and the beauty behind even the simplest subjects."
    ch2_emi "I see, you really put a lot of thought behind these pictures, huh?"
    izumi "Yeah, that's right. Even though they're still images, they feel alive in a way. Whenever I attend exhibitions, that's the feeling I get from the work of other photographers."
    izumi "The hard part is just figuring out how to capture that feeling myself."
    ch2_emi "So if you manage to achieve that, would you be satisfied with your photos then?"
    izumi "I would think so. I'd love to see that sense of life and emotion in my own work."
    ch2_emi "(Hmm, it might've been for the better that I chose the waterfall over the maple trees then.)"
    ch2_emi "(I hope we manage to take some photos that are up to his standards later on.)"

    narrator "I grow excited and prepare myself to run down the path, only to be stopped by Izumi's firm grip on my wrist."
    izumi "Sis, don't go running off. You know I can't take strenuous exercise. My heart won't be able to keep up."
    ch2_emi "Oh, that's right. Sorry, I got too excited for a second there."
    ch2_emi "Let's just walk at our own pace then."

    izumi "Um, maybe I should just take more nature shots instead. I mean, people might not want to be bothered. . ."
    ch2_emi "(. . .He seems just as nervous as earlier. Maybe he's more anxious about this than I realized.)"
    ch2_emi "That's okay, we don't have to ask someone else if they're busy. How about I model for you instead?"

    izumi "Hmm, you can do whatever feels natural to you. I don't think you need to think too hard about it."
    izumi "If you really can't think of anything, just look at me and smile."

    izumi "Maybe I'm being too perfectionistic, but what does it matter if I can't take photos that aren't up to my standards?"
