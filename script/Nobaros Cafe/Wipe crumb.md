# Wipe crumb
Emi: "Kai, hold still."

Kai: "Huh?"

*I bring a hand to his cheek, brushing the crumb off with a quick swipe.*

Emi: "There we go! Okay, everything's all good now."

Kai: "Wha. . ."

Emi: "(. . .Huh?)"

*Kai's face flushes beet red and immediately stops bobbing his shoulders. His confident expression melts away, replaced by trembling eyes and mouth agape.*

Emi: "(Oh my gosh, his ears are as red as his shirt! He's literally a tomato!)"

*I bite my lip, stifling a laugh. Somehow, it's amusing to see him all flustered for a change.*

Kai: "W-w-what was that about?!"

Emi: "S-sorry, there was just a crumb on your cheek and it was distracting me, so. . ."

Kai: "A crumb?! You scared me, I thought you were going to. . ."

Emi: "You thought what?"

Kai: "N-nevermind! Forget what I said!"

Kai: "A-anyways, thanks for that! We sh-should probably head on home now!"

*I giggle as Kai hides his face with his towel. He turns and heads up the trail in awkward strides, the tips of his ears peeking out of the towel.*

Emi: "(. . . I think I kind of get why he likes pranks so much.)"

*A joyful, warm feeling bubbles in my chest. I run after him, trying to keep up before he leaves me behind.*

Kai: "By the way, what's for dinner?"

Emi: "Oh, I'm not too sure actually. Ingram didn't mention."

Kai: "Hmm, let's make a bet then! Winner gets the rest of those macarons in your hands."

Emi: "Okay, I'm down!"

Kai: "Sweet! Alright, for my guess, I bet he's making cream stew tonight."

Emi: "What? How'd you come up with that?"

Kai: "Just my gut instinct really. I'm craving some right now."

Emi: "You're just hungry!"

Kai: "Hehe, well, it's a guess nonetheless!"

Kai: "Well then, what do you think he's gonna make? Any guesses?"

Emi: "Hmm. . . then I'm going to say curry rice!"

Kai: "Alright, prepare to lose those macarons."

Emi: "Hey, we aren't even home yet! How are you so sure you're going to win?"

Kai: "I can feel it in my stomach."

Emi: "Hey, no tooting your own horn, haha!"

*I punch his arm, earning a fit of laughter from him. He tries to nuzzle my head as revenge, but I run away before he's able to get a hold of me.*

*For the rest of the way home, we play a little game of tag, laughing every time we catch the other.*
