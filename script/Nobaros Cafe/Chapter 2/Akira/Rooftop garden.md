# Rooftop garden
Emi: "Fruit tarts sound good. Let's make those!"

Ingram: "Sounds good. Those tend to be popular with the cafe's younger customers, because of how aesthetic the sliced fruits look on top."

Ingram: "This will be a good chance for you to practice your assembly skills."

Emi: "Ooo, that sounds exciting! What fruits are we using?"

Ingram: "To get that aesthetic look, you want a combination of blue, red, yellow and green. We can use different berries to get blue and red, and kiwis for the pop of green."

Ingram: "As for yellow. . . I usually use mangoes, but they aren't always available. So I'm thinking of switching it up and using peaches instead."

Ingram: "I think the peaches on the rooftop should be just about ripe by now."

Emi: "There's a rooftop garden?!"

Ingram: "Hmm? Yeah, you didn't know? It's just right at the top of the stairs."

Emi: "No, I've never been! Can I go pick the peaches?"

Ingram: "Sure, knock yourself out. Let me just get you something to collect them in."

*Ingram digs into the cupboard underneath the sink, pulling out an off-white canvas bag.*

Emi: "(A rooftop garden! That's so cool, I can't wait to see it!)"

Ingram: "Feel free to pick all of them. If there's any we don't use, we can just cut them up as a snack. for later"

Emi: "Sounds good to me! I'll be right back."

Ingram: "Have fun."

*As I reach the top of the stairs, I'm hit with a fresh, earthly scent. The sound of leaves rustling mixes with the trickling of water from a fountain nearby.*

*I shield my eyes from the sunlight and walk through the garden, admiring the abundance of fruit growing around. On one side, there's strawberries and raspberries, forming a line of red along the edge.*

*Opposite to them are several herbs. I rub my fingers against one of their leaves and sniff.*

Emi: "(Oh, this is basil! That could go well with the fruits.)"

Akira: ". . . Emi?"

*Just then, Akira approaches me, carrying a watering can.*

Emi: "Akira! Good morning, how's it going?"

*Akira's surprised face softens, and he smiles.*

Akira: "Good morning to you too. I'm just watering the plants."

Akira: "I didn't expect to see you up here. What are you up to?"

Emi: "Oh, I came looking for some peaches! Ingram and I are making fruit tarts for today's baking practice session, and he told me there'd be some here."

Akira: "Ah, peaches? I know where those are, follow me."

*He walks towards the center of the rooftop garden, leading me to a bunch of potted plants. In one of the pots stands a small tree that's just as tall as Akira, its branches full of ripe, juicy peaches.*

Akira: "Here it is."

Emi: "Oh my gosh, it's so cute! I thought peach trees were huge. I didn't expect to see one that's this size."

Akira: "Haha, well you'd be right if it was a regular sized peach tree."

Akira: "This is a dwarf tree though, so it's small enough to fit inside a big pot. They're a lot easier to grow on a rooftop."

Emi: "Oh, that's interesting."

Akira: "It requires a lot of sunlight, so I made a special sunbathing spot for it right here."

*He steps forward and grabs one of the peaches, twisting it off the branch.*

Akira: "Here, why don't you try one?"

Emi: "Yeah, sure! Thanks."

*Taking the peach from him, I wipe it on my shirt and have a bite, my teeth sinking into its soft flesh.*

Emi: "Whoa!"

*Almost immediately, juice comes pouring out, and I instinctively step back as the juice drops onto the ground.*

Akira: "Haha, that's a juicy one! What do you think?"

Emi: "Mmm, it's really sweet!"

Akira: "That's right. Although these peaches are slightly smaller, they're also a bit sweeter and juicier than regular peaches."

Akira: "They've just about ripened, so I'm sure they'll go great in the fruit tarts."

Emi: "I agree! I'll start picking then. Thanks for showing me where they are!"

Akira: "No worries. I can help with picking if you'd like. I'm just about finished watering the plants anyways."

Emi: "That'd be much appreciated!"

*The two of us get to harvesting the peaches, with Akira picking the ones near the top while I go for the ones at the bottom.*

Emi: "(The sun's starting to feel really hot. . .)"

Emi: "(. . .Huh?)"

*Just then, I find Akira standing behind me, shading me from the sun.*

Emi: "(Did he mean to do that? I can't tell. . .)"

Emi: "(. . . I noticed it before, but he's really tall huh? He's grabbing those peaches without any trouble.)"

*Before long, we finish picking the all of the peaches. The canvas bag is considerably heavier than before and I find myself needing to use two hands to balance it.*

Emi: "Akira, are you on the rooftop often?"

Akira: "Hmm? What makes you say that?"

Emi: "Well, when I mentioned peaches earlier, you immediately knew where they were."

Akira: "You've caught me. Though to be fair, I've had plenty of time to memorize the layout of the garden since I first arrived."

Akira: "Actually, I'm usually up here because of house chores usually."

Emi: "House chores?"

Akira: "That's right. Since Ingram is the one with the most on his plate, the rest of us do our best to maintain the house."

Akira: "Originally, taking care of the garden was purely my responsibility, but Annelise wanted to split the job up."

Akira: "So we usually take turns coming up here in the morning."

Akira: "If I had to guess, she's probably all holed up inside her room at the moment with some kind of book in her hands."

Emi: "That does sound like her. . ."

Emi: "What about Kai?"

Akira: "Kai makes sure everything on the first floor is clean. Once in a while, he'll also take over cooking duty when Ingram's especially busy."

Emi: "Hmm, everyone has a role around the house huh. . ."

Akira: "It's a pretty good system honestly. Keeps things organized, and nobody has an overwhelming amount of work to do."

Emi: "Well, I don't have a role at the moment. . . Surely, I can help out somewhere too. It just feels weird not doing my part."

Akira: "Well, if you ask me, I think you have plenty of things to worry about considering you're working at the cafe."

Akira: "That's a large portion of Ingram's responsibilities, and although he doesn't like to admit it, I think he definitely needed some help around there."

Akira: "Plus, you're very easy to talk to and everyone seems to enjoy your company."

Akira: "I think that you've definitely earned your spot as a roommate, if you want to think of it that way."

*I blush a little at Akira's words, happy to hear that I'm already a part of the group.*

Emi: "W-well, I'm still getting to know everyone, but I think you guys are really nice people. I'm really looking forward to spending more time together and becoming closer friends."

Akira: "I'm sure you'll get there."

Akira: "Here's a fun fact about me to get you started: peaches are my favourite fruit."

Emi: "Oh, really? What do you like about them?"

Akira: "Well, I've liked them since I was a kid, so I guess it's probably because of the nostalgia."

Emi: "Okay, then I'll make sure to do my best with the tarts later! They'll be so good that you'll be begging for more!"

Akira: "Haha, okay, I look forward to them then. Try not to make them too sweet, I'm not a fan of super sweet things."

Emi: "Noted! Make sure to come down to the kitchen when they're done, or else, there won't be any left for you."

Akira: "I'll definitely make sure to grab one. I'll see you later then, good luck."

Emi: "Ingram, I'm back! Here's the peaches."

*I burst into the kitchen, spotting Ingram at the countertop with several ingredients laid out in front of him. I set the bag of peaches nearby, catching my breath from rushing down the stairs.*

Ingram: "Welcome back. I've prepared all the ingredients already."

*He hands me an apron. As I proceed to tie it, he brings out two mixing bowls.*

Ingram: "How was the rooftop? Did you enjoy yourself?"

Emi: "It was good! There were a lot more plants up there than I expected. It's really well maintained!"

Emi: "I ran into Akira up there, and he helped me with finding and picking the peaches."

Ingram: "Good to hear. It must've been fun being up there. You look a little more energized."

Emi: "O-oh, do I? Maybe it was from being in the sun. I always feel happier whenever it's sunny outside."

*Ingram smiles. Just as I finish tying my apron, I join him at the counter.*

Ingram: "Alright, so the tart is made up of 3 main components: the crust, pastry cream and fruits. We're going to start with the crust."

Emi: "Okay, sounds good!"

*I watch attentively as Ingram adds some water, butter and flour to his mixing bowl. He takes a fork and begins combining them in a slicing motion.*

*I do my best to follow his movements and mirror his motions. Although he finishes much faster than me, I somehow manage to follow along without messing up.*

*As we move onto the pastry cream, Ingram instructs me to combine some ingredients in a saucepan.*

Emi: "(Oh! I shouldn't add too much sugar, so that Akira can enjoy this too later.)"

*I shave off some of the sugar in my measuring cup, and add it to the saucepan.*

*We work through the rest of the recipe in tandem, and eventually, we finish an entire batch of decadent fruit tarts.*

*I stare at the tarts, comparing the differences between my assembly and Ingram's.*

Emi: "(Hmm. . . there's a few that look pretty sloppy. Oh, but hey, this one didn't turn out too bad!)"

Emi: "(I think I'll leave this one for Akira as thanks for helping me pick the peaches earlier.)"

*I take one of the better-looking tarts and leave it aside on a plate.*

Ingram: "Hey, these don't look too bad. You did pretty well for your first try."

Emi: "Thanks. I was doing my best to follow you, but I think I'm still getting the hang of it. Some of them turned out a bit wonky."

Ingram: "Hmm, well, these ones do look a little messy. They have uneven amounts of pastry cream and there's some big gaps between the fruit slices."

Emi: "(O-ouch. . . he really doesn't know how to hold back the punches.)"

*I hide my hands behind my back, feeling quite small as Ingram criticizes my tarts.*

Ingram: "But these are your first few attempts right? See these at the end? They're a lot more consistent, and they have a much more refined appearance."

Ingram: "I'd sell these at the cafe."

Emi: ". . .!"

Emi: "Really? You think so?"

Ingram: "Yep, I'd say so. Now the question is how they taste."

Ingram: "Let's call everyone down to get multiple opinions."

Emi: "(E-everyone at once? I hope they like it. . .)"

*Ingram heads into the common area and walks over to the bottom of the stairs.*

Ingram: "Hey guys, there's some fruit tarts downstairs! Come down and have a taste!"

*In a heartbeat, Kai and Annelise burst out of their rooms and zoom into the kitchen. A few moments after, Akira also appears at the entrance to the kitchen, covering his mouth as he yawns.*

Emi: "Akira, your hair's all messy! Did we call you at a bad time?"

Akira: "Oh, don't worry about it. I was napping earlier, but I woke up around 10 minutes ago."

Akira: "I could smell the baking right from my room. I'm definitely ready to try a tart now."

Emi: "Oh, of course! Here, I saved you one as thanks for helping me on the rooftop earlier!"

Akira: "Thank you. I appreciate it."

*As I grab the tart I set aside earlier, I see Kai and Annelise crowded around the counter, marveling at all the tarts in front of them.*

Annelise: "They look so aesthetic! You guys did so well!"

Kai: "Yeah, I can hardly wait to get my hands on one and have a bite!"

Ingram: "Well, that's what we called you down for. Go ahead and take one from Emi's tray here."

*As soon as Ingram finishes his sentence, Kai and Annelise swipe a tart and bite right into it. I grab a tart for myself and stare at it in nervous anticipation.*

Emi: "(Please turn out good. . . !)"

*As I take a bite of the tart, the flaky crust crumbles delicately under my teeth. The pastry cream melts onto my tongue, giving a smooth mouthfeel filled with the rich taste of eggs, milk and vanilla.*

*The fruits add a refreshing tanginess to the tart, cutting through the richness of the cream. Although the tart isn't that sweet, the combination of textures and subtle tastes leaves me feeling satisfied.*

Annelise: "Mmm! The fruits are so sweet!"

Ingram: "This is pretty good, nicely done. We can consider today's baking session was a success."

Ingram: "Next time, I'll be counting on you to make the fruit tarts for the cafe."

Emi: ". . . !"

*I feel my heart soar from Ingram's compliment.* 

Ingram: "Of course, if these tarts didn't turn out good, I was going to have you make more until you get the hang of it."

Emi: "Well, it's a good thing I got it on the first try then!"

*Out of the corner of my eyes, I spot Kai and Annelise reaching out for another tart. I walk over and take away the tarts, preventing them from grabbing one.*

Emi: "Hey! It's almost dinner time, shouldn't you be saving room for that?"

Kai: "What? But it's just one more small tart!"

Emi: "No."

Annelise: "Please Emi? I'll brew some special tea for us if you'll just let me have one more!"

Kai: "Th-that's right! And I'll wash the dishes too!"

Emi: "We only made so many tarts guys. Can't you wait to have them until after dinner? Like for dessert or something?"

Akira: "Excuse me, I just need to pass through you guys here."

*Akira cuts into our conversation, placing his plate into the sink. He turns to face me with a smile.*

Akira: "The tart was good, I really enjoyed it. Thanks for going easy on the sugar, it was just perfect for me."

*Akira's compliment catches me off guard, and I grow flustered.*

Emi: "Th-thank you! I was just trying to make sure everyone could enjoy the tart, and not just the sweet tooths. . ."

Kai: "Well, even as a sweet tooth, these are good! You should call us again the next time Ingram's teaching you baking."

Emi: "Aw, I'm glad to hear that. Thanks Ka-WHEN DID YOU GRAB ANOTHER TART?!"

*I stare in shock as Kai and Annelise bite into another tart, their cheeks full like happy hamsters.*

*I turn to Ingram, who chuckles in response.*

Ingram: "Well, there's definitely a next time. There's still other desserts that you haven't learned yet."

Emi: "Whatever gets me closer to baking at the actual cafe! Throw me at them!"

*As everyone clears out of the kitchen, I store away the tarts into a large container and begin washing the dishes. Ingram, on the other hand, starts preparing dinner for everyone.*

Emi: "(I'm really glad that the tart turned out okay. That was a fun baking session.)"

Emi: "(Who knew that we grew fruits right on our own rooftop!)"

*The image of Akira standing over me flashes through my mind.*

Emi: "(. . . I'm still not sure whether he even did that on purpose.)"

Emi: "(Maybe I'm overthinking it. Him being there was probably just a coincidence. . .)"
