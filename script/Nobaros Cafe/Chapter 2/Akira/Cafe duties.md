# Cafe duties
*With a resigned sigh, I shake my head, acknowledging that my chores should take priority.*

*If I slack off now, there's a chance that I wouldn't be able to finish them all in time.*

Emi: "Sorry, I would love to, but I'll have to take a rain check. There's a lot of work I need to focus on before the day ends."

Akira: "I see. I understand, no need to apologize. I admire your work ethic."

*Akira gracefully lifts the cup to his lips, savouring the last sip of his espresso.*

*With a fluid motion, he finishes the drink and extends the empty cup to me. He stretches leisurely, a long sigh escaping his lips.*

Akira: "Well then, I've stuck around for long enough now. The sun has made me drowsy, so I think I'll take a stroll to wake myself up."

*I watch as Akira stands up, a sense of regret creeping in.* 

*Despite running into each other twice now, I still don't know very much about him. I wish I had more time to chat with him, to learn about his experiences in Nobaros.*

*As Akira makes his way to the door, he turns back and smiles at me.*

Akira: "It's been a pleasure, good luck with your shift."

Akira: "Perhaps we can continue our conversation next time."

Emi: ". . . !"

Emi: "Yes, definitely! Have a good day, I'll see you at Yuugen House."

*His departure leaves me with a sense of missed opportunity, a feeling that maybe I should have taken him up on his offer and savoured the moment.*

*I sigh softly, knowing that duty calls and I ultimately made the responsible choice.*

Emi: "(Next time, I'll definitely take the chance to converse with him properly!)"

Emi: "(Let's quickly finish up here and return the rags.)"
