# Meeting Akira
Emi: "Let's go clean up some empty dishes."

*I grab a few of the neatly folded rags and head back out to the floor.* 

*A peaceful hum lingers, customers engrossed in conversation throughout the space.*

*The soft murmur of voices creates a soothing backdrop, inviting all who enter to relax and unwind in the welcoming embrace of the cafe.*

*Starting at the table closest to me, I gingerly gather the dirty dishes.*

*The ceramic dishes clink softly as I stack them, their surfaces adorned with remnants of delicious meals enjoyed by the customers.*

*Once the dishes are cleared, I swiftly wipe down the surface with a rag. As I progress, the pure white look of the rag turns discoloured from all the spills and crumbs.*

*Soon, the smooth tabletop gleams, revealing the intricate wood grain underneath.*

*I move onto the next table, scanning for any signs of leftover dishes.*

Emi: "Hm? Isn't that. . ."

*My eyes fall on the corner of the cafe, where a familiar figure lounges around.*

*He savours his espresso with small, deliberate sips, the steam dissipating in a lazy manner. Sunlight filters through the window, enveloping him in a warm aura.*

*Drawing slightly closer, I squint in an attempt to discern his features.*

Emi: "(It's Akira! I ran into him back at Yuugen House the other night.)"

*His sun-kissed hair is styled in a clean fashion, with a few golden strands tucked behind his ear.*

*The rose-brown hue of his eyes are framed by a sophisticated pair of glasses. A green blazer casually drapes over the shoulders of his well-fitted black dress shirt, tying the look together with a sense of refinement.*

*He sets down his espresso, his gaze fixed on the scenery outside. Despite his relaxed posture, there's a subtle intensity in his eyes, as if he's analyzing the world around him.*

*There's an undeniable charm about him, an aura of nonchalance that makes it seem like he could fall asleep anytime. Yet his presence is striking, leaving a lasting impression on anyone who crosses his path.*

Emi: "(. . .!!)"

Emi: "(What am I doing? Snap out of it Emi! You're in the middle of working. Stop ogling at him before he catches you!)"

*Just then, our eyes meet. Akira recognizes me immediately and waves hello, gesturing for me to come over.*

Emi: "(He didn't catch me staring just now, did he?)"

*I swallow my pride and make my way over to him, pretending that I just noticed him.*

*Akira greets me with a kind smile, adjusting his posture as I approach the table.*

Akira: "Hello, we meet again."

Akira: "You're Emi, right? I believe we met back at Yuugen House the other night." 

Emi: "Y-yes, I remember you. I think you said your name is Akira?"

Emi: "(Why am I stammering!? I need to calm down.)"

Akira: "Bingo, you've got the right guy."

Akira: "Are you busy? It's a lovely day out, and it'd be nice to chat with someone to pass the time."

*A small voice at the back of my mind tempts me to join Akira.*

Emi: "Oh, sorry, I'm in the middle of doing something. I need to collect some empty dishes and clean tables."

Akira: "Ah, is that so? So Ingram has already assigned you a fair amount of chores to work on, huh?"

*Akira shifts his gaze, scanning the cafe as he observes the other tables. I peek at the espresso cup in front of him.*

Emi: "(Is he almost done with his drink? It looks like there's just a sip or two left.)"

*Noticing my gaze, Akira picks up the cup and holds it in his hands, meeting my eyes with another warm smile.*

Akira: "It seems everyone else is still engrossed in their conversations."

Akira: "Since I'm nearly finished with my espresso, why don't you take a short break and join me? It'll give you a chance to rest and also clear some dishes."

*He gestures towards the other tables, where customers are still chatting away.*

Akira: "Plus, it'll help you kill two birds with one stone, as they say."

*Akira's offer is quite convincing, and the little voice in my head continues to tempt me.*
