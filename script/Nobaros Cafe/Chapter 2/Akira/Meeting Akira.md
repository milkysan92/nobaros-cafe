Emi: "Let's go clean up some empty dishes."

*I grab a few of the neatly folded rags and head back out to the floor.* 

*A peaceful hum lingers, customers engrossed in conversation throughout the space.*

*The soft murmur of voices creates a soothing backdrop, inviting all who enter to relax and unwind in the welcoming embrace of the cafe.*

*Starting at the table closest to me, I gingerly gather the dirty dishes.*

*The ceramic dishes clink softly as I stack them, their surfaces adorned with remnants of delicious meals enjoyed by the customers.*

*Once the dishes are cleared, I swiftly wipe down the surface with a rag. As I progress, the pure white look of the rag turns discoloured from all the spills and crumbs.*

*Soon, the smooth tabletop gleams, revealing the intricate wood grain underneath.*

*I move onto the next table, scanning for any signs of leftover dishes.*

Emi: "Hm? Isn't that. . ."

*My eyes fall on the corner of the cafe, where a familiar figure lounges around.*

*He savours his espresso with small, deliberate sips, the steam dissipating in a lazy manner. Sunlight filters through the window, enveloping him in a warm aura.*

*Drawing slightly closer, I squint in an attempt to discern his features.*

Emi: "(It's Akira! I ran into him back at Yuugen House the other night.)"

*His sun-kissed hair is styled in a clean fashion, with a few golden strands tucked behind his ear.*

*The rose-brown hue of his eyes are framed by a sophisticated pair of glasses. A green blazer casually drapes over the shoulders of his well-fitted black dress shirt, tying the look together with a sense of refinement.*

*He sets down his espresso, his gaze fixed on the scenery outside. Despite his relaxed posture, there's a subtle intensity in his eyes, as if he's analyzing the world around him.*

*There's an undeniable charm about him, an aura of nonchalance that makes it seem like he could fall asleep anytime. Yet his presence is striking, leaving a lasting impression on anyone who crosses his path.*

Emi: "(. . .!!)"

Emi: "(What am I doing? Snap out of it Emi! You're in the middle of working. Stop ogling at him before he catches you!)"

*Just then, our eyes meet. Akira recognizes me immediately and waves hello, gesturing for me to come over.*

Emi: "(He didn't catch me staring just now, did he?)"

*I swallow my pride and make my way over to him, pretending that I just noticed him.*

*Akira greets me with a kind smile, adjusting his posture as I approach the table.*

Akira: "Hello, we meet again."

Akira: "You're Emi, right? I believe we met back at Yuugen House the other night." 

Emi: "Y-yes, I remember you. I think you said your name is Akira?"

Emi: "(Why am I stammering!? I need to calm down.)"

Akira: "Bingo, you've got the right guy."

Akira: "Are you busy? It's a lovely day out, and it'd be nice to chat with someone to pass the time."

*A small voice at the back of my mind tempts me to join Akira.*

Emi: "Oh, sorry, I'm in the middle of doing something. I need to collect some empty dishes and clean tables."

Akira: "Ah, is that so? So Ingram has already assigned you a fair amount of chores to work on, huh?"

*Akira shifts his gaze, scanning the cafe as he observes the other tables. I peek at the espresso cup in front of him.*

Emi: "(Is he almost done with his drink? It looks like there's just a sip or two left.)"

*Noticing my gaze, Akira picks up the cup and holds it in his hands, meeting my eyes with another warm smile.*

Akira: "It seems everyone else is still engrossed in their conversations."

Akira: "Since I'm nearly finished with my espresso, why don't you take a short break and join me? It'll give you a chance to rest and also clear some dishes."

*He gestures towards the other tables, where customers are still chatting away.*

Akira: "Plus, it'll help you kill two birds with one stone, as they say."

*Akira's offer is quite convincing, and the little voice in my head continues to tempt me.*
# Focus on cafe chores
*With a resigned sigh, I shake my head, acknowledging that my chores should take priority.*

*If I slack off now, there's a chance that I wouldn't be able to finish them all in time.*

Emi: "Sorry, I would love to, but I'll have to take a rain check. There's a lot of work I need to focus on before the day ends."

Akira: "I see. I understand, no need to apologize. I admire your work ethic."

*Akira gracefully lifts the cup to his lips, savouring the last sip of his espresso.*

*With a fluid motion, he finishes the drink and extends the empty cup to me. He stretches leisurely, a long sigh escaping his lips.*

Akira: "Well then, I've stuck around for long enough now. The sun has made me drowsy, so I think I'll take a stroll to wake myself up."

*I watch as Akira stands up, a sense of regret creeping in.* 

*Despite running into each other twice now, I still don't know very much about him. I wish I had more time to chat with him, to learn about his experiences in Nobaros.*

*As Akira makes his way to the door, he turns back and smiles at me.*

Akira: "It's been a pleasure, good luck with your shift."

Akira: "Perhaps we can continue our conversation next time."

Emi: ". . . !"

Emi: "Yes, definitely! Have a good day, I'll see you at Yuugen House."

*His departure leaves me with a sense of missed opportunity, a feeling that maybe I should have taken him up on his offer and savoured the moment.*

*I sigh softly, knowing that duty calls and I ultimately made the responsible choice.*

Emi: "(Next time, I'll definitely take the chance to converse with him properly!)"

Emi: "(Let's quickly finish up here and return the rags.)"
# Sit down and chat
Emi: "You know what, you have a point! It can't hurt to take a little break."

*I plop down on the seat across from Akira, sinking into the comfortable cushion on the chair. He smiles, pleased that I've accepted his invitation.*

Akira: "I'm glad to hear that. It's always nice to have some company on a day like today."

Akira: "It's also important to take breaks from time to time, don't you think?"

*His easygoing demeanor puts me at ease, and I find myself relaxing in no time. I return his smile, feeling a sense of warmth at his words.*

Akira: "So how's everything going around the cafe? You're fairly new, yet you're already working so diligently."

Emi: "Oh, I'm learning a lot from Ingram! But I've still got a long way to go before I get to whip up some fancy desserts though."

Akira: "Is that so? You seem so excited to get baking, is there a particular reason?"

Emi: "Have you seen those cakes in the display case? They look absolutely stunning!"

Emi: "Wouldn't it be really cool if I could do that myself? I'd love to create something so pretty-looking."

Emi: "There's also something special about seeing people enjoy what I've made with my own two hands."

*Akira chuckles softly, his laughter like a melody that fills the air. As I speak, I notice a spark of recognition in his eyes, as if he understands the satisfaction of pursuing one's passions.*

*Leaning forward, he rests his chin on his hand, his gaze full of intrigue and curiosity.*

Akira: "That's admirable. Both precision and skill are essential to creating such complicated desserts, so it's good to hone them through practice."

Akira: "As a regular, I'd be honoured to taste your creations someday."

*I feel a surge of pride at his compliment, grateful for his recognition.*

Emi: "Thank you, I'm touched that you think so highly of me."

Akira: "Of course. Only through diligence and perseverance can you expect to reap meaningful results."

*I stare as Akira takes another sip of his espresso.*

*His calm demeanor exudes a sense of confidence that is both comforting and inspiring. He seems so at ease, blending seamlessly into his surroundings.*

Emi: "(I wonder if he's been here for a while. . .)"

Akira: "How are you finding Nobaros? Adjusting well?"

*His question catches me off guard, as if he's read my mind.*

Emi: "Eh? Ah, I mean, it's. . . different. I'm still trying to get my bearings to be honest. But I do appreciate how tranquil this place is. I think I'll slowly be able to adjust."

Akira: "I understand. When I first arrived, it was quite overwhelming. Nobaros was unlike anything I've experienced before. But I've found it to be quite nice, a place of introspection and growth if you will."

Emi: "It's reassuring to hear that. What was your first impression of Nobaros, if you don't mind me asking?"

Akira: "Frankly speaking, I was in disbelief. The concept of being in a place like this, where people who have passed on or are close to it coexist, was unfathomable to me."

Akira: "Walking around here with that in mind was a strange feeling. And even more so when I realized that included me."

Akira: "But over time, I've come to appreciate the peace it offers. It provided an opportunity to slow down and reflect on a lot of things."

Akira: "Things that I would've never stopped to think about in reality."

Emi: "(No wonder he seems so well-adjusted. . .)"

*As Akira gracefully savours another sip of his espresso, I couldn't help but wonder about his life before Nobaros. What kind of life did he lead in the real world? 

*With a fluid motion, he finishes the drink and extends the empty cup to me.*

*Rising from his seat, he stretches languidly, a sigh of satisfaction escaping his lips. He looks content, as if our conversation has left him refreshed.*

Akira: "Well then, I've kept you from your duties long enough. The sun has made me drowsy, so I think I'll take a stroll to wake myself up."

Akira: "Thanks for entertaining me, it's been a pleasure."

Akira: "Good luck with your shift."

Emi: "Thank you! Enjoy your walk."

*I watch as Akira leaves, a sense of contentment washing over me.*

*As I hold his empty cup, I feel a tinge in my chest, part of me wishing that there was more time to chat with him.*

*I sigh softly, knowing that duty calls. But I'm also content, happy with the choice I made.*

Emi: "(Let's quickly finish up here and return the rags.)"
