Emi: Let's sweep the foyer!

*I grab the broom leaning against the corner and head out to the floor, collecting all the dust and dirt that accumulated throughout the day. I start by forming small dust piles under each table, then nudging them towards a corner where a bigger pile awaits.*

*As I sweep under the last table, I notice a glint of light slide across the floor. Taking a closer look, I crouch down and inspect the dust pile.*

*To my surprise, I find a small gold charm in the shape of a camellia flower. The charm was intricately detailed, with carefully sculpted petals that look as if they could be squished by the lightest touch. On the back of the flower, there's an engraving of the number "8".

Emi: "What a pretty charm! I wonder where it came from. . . maybe someone's necklace or something?"

*I decide to keep the charm, in case the owner comes back looking for it. Storing the charm in a small pocket in my apron, I continue and finish up with sweeping the foyer.*

*I collect the big dust pile in a dustpan and dump it in a nearby trashcan, feeling a sense of accomplishment as I do so. I momentarily set the broom aside to go wash my hands behind the counter. Just as I am about to finish up, the front door suddenly bursts open and a blaring voice shatters my eardrums.

???: "INGRAM!! ARE YOU IN HERE?!"

*I shoot my eyes towards the cafe entrance, seeing a guy around my age standing right at the doorway. He's panting heavily, as if he had been sprinting just before arriving, and his jacket is barely clinging to his shoulders.* 

*Out of the corner of my eye, I see Ingram is in the middle of refilling the macarons in the display case. He hadn't even noticed the front door had swung right open.* 

*In his stead, I quickly pat my hands dry with a nearby towel and approach the disheveled guy to see what the ruckus is.*

Emi: "Sorry, Ingram is busy at the moment. Can I help you with something?"

*The guy shoots a desperate look at me and claps his hands together, as if he's about to pray.*

???: "Oh thank god you're here! I lost something and I think it might be somewhere around here."

Emi: "What did you lose? Maybe I can help you find it."

???: "It's a small gold trinket thingy. It should look like a flower of some kind."

Emi: "Wait a minute, could you be talking about this?"

*I dig into my apron pocket and fish out the golden camellia charm I found earlier. As I lay it in my palm and show it to the guy, his eyes light up enthusiastically and he nods in excitement.*

???: "That's the one! Thanks a bunch!"

*I place the charm in the guy's hands and he inspects it more closely. I can't help but wonder what a guy like him was doing with a camellia charm. It didn't really seem to fit his image.*

Emi: "So how did you lose the charm? Was it from a piece of jewelry or something?"

???:  "Oh, lemme show you!"

*The guy rolls up his left sleeve, revealing a jade bracelet wrapped around his slender wrist. He turns the bracelet a bit, revealing a small section of gold that connected one end of the bracelet to the other. With a brief motion, he reattaches the camellia charm to the gold section. The charm taps against the jade beads as he does so, and a distinct clink resonates.*

???: "The charm is a part of this bracelet! It's been with me ever since I came here. I don't really know why, but I feel weirdly empty taking it off so I just keep it on me at all times." 

???: "See this engraving of the number eight on the back? Eight is a lucky number, so I like to think of this as my lucky charm in a way! So when I found out the charm went missing, I really panicked."

???: "I'm glad it was safe in your hands. I guess I got real lucky in that sense, since it's easy to miss such a small charm. Otherwise, I don't know what I would've done if it was gone for good."

*The guy flashes a wide grin at me, which I warmly reciprocate. Seeing him so cheerful after getting the charm back makes me feel happy for him. The bracelet must mean a lot to him.*

Emi: "(His energy is contagious. . . I feel my mood improving just from talking to him.)"

???: "By the way, you're new around here aren't you? I don't think I've ever seen someone other than Ingram working here."

???: "Actually scratch that, I don't think I've ever seen Ingram working with *anybody* period. . . 

???: "But never mind that! Let me introduce myself. My name's Kai, what's yours?"

Emi: "Oh right, I'm Emi! I'm helping Ingram out with both the cafe and with spirit guiding. It's nice to meet you."

Kai: "Wait, did you say your name's Emi? I think I know you! Ingram was mentioning that we'd be getting a new roommate at Yuugen house!"

Kai: "I was wondering what you looked like! So how are you faring so far? Have you managed to regain any memories yet?" 

Kai: "How about the spirit guiding stuff? Did you-"

*Kai begins excitedly barraging me with questions, getting closer as he asks each one. He's talking at lightning speed, making it hard for me to comprehend what he's trying to ask.*

*Before I manage to even open my mouth to respond, a large growl cuts Kai's questions off. The growl is heard loud and clear and the two of us stare at each other in silence.*

Emi: ". . ."

Kai: ". . ."

Emi: ". . .Was that you?"

Kai: "No way, I don't know what you're talking about. That's gotta be you."

Emi: "But I just ate lunch a few hours ago! I think I'd know if it was my own stomach that growled."

*Just then, another growl rumbles. This time, it's clearly coming from Kai's stomach.*

Kai: ". . ."

Kai: "Do. Not. Say. Anything."

Emi: ". . . I-"

Kai: "AHHH!! Okay okay, you've got me."

*I hadn't even said anything before Kai waves his hands around to try and stop me from talking. I could see his entire face turning beet red from embarrassment, reaching up to the tips of his ears.*

Kai: "Okay so I may or may not have skipped lunch 'cause I was looking for my charm all afternoon. . ."

Emi: "You haven't eaten yet?!"

*Kai shakes his head. He pitifully holds his stomach as smaller growls begin to moan out, signifying that he was starving.*

Emi: "(I feel bad for him. . . he almost looks like a sad puppy.)"

Emi: "Okay, hold on, I have an idea. I can go find something for you to eat from behind the counter."

Kai: "Wait wait, stealing food is a crime! There's no need for you to go to such lengths to fill my stomach."

Emi: "What? No, you've got it all wrong, I'm not gonna steal from the display case."

Emi: "Sometimes, we have stuff that can't be sold because they don't look that good or aren't fresh enough."

*I didn't have the heart to tell him that half of the ugly desserts were made by me, as a result of Ingram's pastry making sessions. But he didn't have to know that.*

Kai: "Ohhh, that makes sense. If that's the case, then I'd be more than happy to take them off your plate!"

Emi: "Okay, just wait here then. I'll go and have a look at what we have."

*I go back to the counter and check the cooler where the off display items were stored. Although there wasn't anything as filling as a sandwich, there were at least some macarons and a strawberry tart.*

Emi: "(Hmm, I should take. . .)"

# Macarons
*I take the macarons and package them in a small bag. After making sure the bag was sealed shut, I head back to the cafe entrance.*

Emi: "(Huh? Where'd he go? I thought I told him to wait here.)"

*I glance around the cafe, scanning for any sign of Kai. Suddenly, a pair of hands slam down on my shoulders, and I let out a startled gasp, dropping the macarons. Kai bursts into laughter, clearly amused by his own prank.*

Kai: "Gotcha, Emi! Sorry, I couldn't resist."

*I turn to glare at him, trying to hide my surprise.*

Emi: "Kai, you scared me!."

Kai: "Aw, come on, it was just a little joke. Here, let me make it up to you."

*He wipes a tear from his eye, composing himself after his fit of laughter. He then picks up the bag of macarons and hands them to me with a sheepish smile.*

Emi: "It isn't very nice to scare someone who went through the trouble of finding food for you."

Kai: "You're right. I'll behave, I promise. So what did you end up finding?"

*With a huff, I push the bag of macarons into his arms.*

Emi: "Unfortunately, I only found some leftover macarons. It probably won't fill you up too much but it was what we had."

*Kai tugs at the bag, peering inside to inspect the macarons. His eyes shine brightly at the sight of them.*

Kai: "Oh sweet! I'll never turn down macarons, they're my favourite! I've been craving them these days too."

Emi: "I'm glad to hear that you have something nice to eat. Just remember that macarons aren't a good substitute for a meal so you should eat a proper meal when you can."

*Kai laughs as he grabs one of the macarons and take a bite. His giddy mood leaks right out of him, and I laugh at how happy he is over a small treat.*

Kai: "Don't worry, I'll make sure to eat a big meal when I get home later then." 

Kai: "I'll head out now, thanks for the help. It was nice to finally meet you, I'll see you later!"

*Kai excitedly waves as he leaves the cafe, the door chime following behind his departure.*

Emi: "(Now that's over with, let's get onto the next chore!)"
# Strawberry tart
*I take out the strawberry tart and place it in a mini box. After making sure the strawberry tart was secure and the box was taped shut, I head back to the cafe entrance.*

Emi: "(Huh? Where'd he go? I thought I told him to wait here.)"

*I glance around the cafe, scanning for any sign of Kai. Suddenly, a pair of hands slam down on my shoulders, and I let out a startled gasp, almost dropping the strawberry tart. Kai bursts into laughter, clearly amused by his own prank.*

Kai: "Gotcha, Emi! Sorry, I couldn't resist."

*I turn to glare at him, trying to hide my surprise.*

Emi: "Kai, you scared me!."

Kai: "Aw, come on, it was just a little joke. Here, let me make it up to you."

*He wipes a tear from his eye, composing himself after his fit of laughter. He rubs the back of his neck, flashing me a sheepish smile.*

Emi: "It isn't very nice to scare someone who went through the trouble of finding food for you."

Kai: "You're right. I'll behave, I promise. So what did you end up finding?"

*With a huff, I push the box containing the strawberry tart into his arms.*

Emi: "Unfortunately, I only found a strawberry tart. It probably won't fill you up too much but it was what we had."

*Kai carefully opens the box, peering inside to inspect the strawberry tart. For a brief moment, his face contorts but it is quickly covered up with a polite smile.*

Kai: "Oh, thanks! I uh, appreciate that you took the time and effort to find something for me."

Emi: "Is something wrong? You don't look very happy."

*Kai averts his gaze, unable to look me in the eye. He hesitates to answer, but eventually he manages to piece together a response.*

Kai: "The truth is, I'm not a very big fan of strawberries. They just don't sit well with me."

Emi: "Oh shoot, I'm so sorry! I should've asked you if you had any preferences before I went to go find something."

Emi: "I can go grab you something else!"

Kai: "No, don't worry about it! I can still eat it. I'll just make sure to eat a big meal when I get home later."

Kai: "Really, it's okay. You didn't know any better."

*I feel bad. As much as I insist, Kai refuses to accept anything else and makes do with the strawberry tart. To prove his point, he take the tart and takes a bite out of it. He forces a smile and shows me a thumbs up, signaling that he's okay. But the expression on his face says otherwise.*

Kai: "Alright, I'm gonna head out now. Thanks so much for the help! It was nice to finally meet you, I'll see you later."

*Kai waves as he leaves the cafe, the door chime following behind his departure.*

Emi: "(Dang it, I should've chosen the macarons. Next time, I'll make sure to ask about dietary preferences instead of assuming.)"

Emi: "(Anyways, now that's over with, let's get onto the next chore.)"
