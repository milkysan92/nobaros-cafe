# Meeting Annelise
Emi: "Let's go give the library a good dusting!"

*I promptly grab the duster hanging on the wall and make a beeline for the library.*

*A sea of novels encased in ebony bookshelves comes into view. Tall glass windows frame the room, cascading the space in a blanket of soft, inviting sunlight.*

*Clusters of cozy armchairs beckon from various corners, each accompanied by a quaint table with a potted plant. The room is steeped in a serene hush, as the rich scent of aged paper mingles with the faint aroma of coffee from the cafe.*

*I carefully step onto the hardwood floor. To my surprise, there isn't a single creak as I slowly shifted my weight to enter the room.*

Emi: "(It's so quiet! I can almost hear the sound of my own breath.)"

*As I wander around, I delicately run my fingers along the neatly organized rows of books, feeling the slightly rough texture of their spines.*

*The selection is vast, ranging from scientific encyclopedias to enchanting novels, each book whispering stories of worlds unknown.* 

*The cozy atmosphere envelops me, tempting me to indulge in a tale or two. I could easily see myself taking a nap in this room if I wasn't careful.*

Emi: "(Now then, where would be a good place to start dusting?)"

Emi: ". . . Ah!"

*Suddenly, my legs are blocked by something solid, and I nearly fall before regaining my footing in the nick of time.*

*I look behind me, finding a pile of books scattered all over the floor, their pages fluttering in the air.*

*On the floor, there's a girl who looks as if she was in the middle of reading.*

*She looks right at me, her eyes wide with surprise. It seems like I startled her by accidentally tripping over her pile of books.*

Emi: "I'm so sorry! I didn't see you there. Are you okay?"

UK_Annelise: "O-oh, um, yes! I'm fine. I was just. . . lost in my books, so I didn't realize someone else entered the room. . ."

*The girl answers in a meek voice that is barely audible. It nearly takes all of my concentration to make out what she's saying.*

*I begin to collect the books scattered across the floor, stacking them neatly beside her.*

*Speaking in a gentle tone, I try my best to make her comfortable.*

Emi: "Don't worry about it, it's my fault for not looking where I was going!"

Emi: "Are you sure you're really alright? I didn't hurt you or anything?"

UK_Annelise: "That's okay, I was just a bit startled that's all."

UK_Annelise: "Thank you for helping with the books. I didn't realize anyone else would be here today. . ."

Emi: "Oh, I'm here to help dust the library as per Ingram's orders!"

Emi: "My name's Emi by the way. I recently started helping out around the cafe, so I'm relatively new around here."

UK_Annelise: "Ah, Ingram? Really? You're a friend of his?"

*Mentioning Ingram's name seems to have sparked something in the girl. Her eyes brighten with a newfound clarity.*

Emi: "Yeah, you could say that! He thought I could help pitch in with things around the cafe, so that's how I ended up here. Oh, and with spirit guiding too!"

UK_Annelise: "Could you be the new girl that Ingram was mentioning? You'll be staying at Yuugen House too then?"

Emi: "That's me! Sorry, but I don't think I caught your name?"

UK_Annelise: "Oh s-sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Annelise. It's nice to have another girl around."
 
*Annelise smiles timidly, feeling a tad more relaxed after realizing that I was a friend of Ingram's.*

Emi: "Alright, I won't disturb you from your reading too much then! I'll get right to cleaning, and you can go back to enjoying your book."

Annelise: "Okay, good luck with the cleaning. Let me know if you need any help."

*Annelise dives right back into her reading as I begin dusting on the other side of the library, taking the opportunity to tidy up the remaining books on the tables.*

*Fortunately, there isn't much dust to clean and I swiftly make my way through the bookshelves, ensuring to get into each nook and cranny.* 

*As I approach Annelise, I notice the pile of books beside her has grown.*

Emi: "(Is she planning to read those books? Or has she already finished them?)"
