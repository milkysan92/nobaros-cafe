# Meeting Annelise
Emi: "Let's go give the library a good dusting!"

*I promptly grab the duster hanging on the wall and make a beeline for the library.*

*A sea of novels encased in ebony bookshelves comes into view. Tall glass windows frame the room, cascading the space in a blanket of soft, inviting sunlight.*

*Clusters of cozy armchairs beckon from various corners, each accompanied by a quaint table with a potted plant. The room is steeped in a serene hush, as the rich scent of aged paper mingles with the faint aroma of coffee from the cafe.*

*I carefully step onto the hardwood floor. To my surprise, there isn't a single creak as I slowly shifted my weight to enter the room.*

Emi: "(It's so quiet! I can almost hear the sound of my own breath.)"

*As I wander around, I delicately run my fingers along the neatly organized rows of books, feeling the slightly rough texture of their spines.*

*The selection is vast, ranging from scientific encyclopedias to enchanting novels, each book whispering stories of worlds unknown.* 

*The cozy atmosphere envelops me, tempting me to indulge in a tale or two. I could easily see myself taking a nap in this room if I wasn't careful.*

Emi: "(Now then, where would be a good place to start dusting?)"

Emi: ". . . Ah!"

*Suddenly, my legs are blocked by something solid, and I nearly fall before regaining my footing in the nick of time.*

*I look behind me, finding a pile of books scattered all over the floor, their pages fluttering in the air.*

*On the floor, there's a girl who looks as if she was in the middle of reading.*

*She looks right at me, her eyes wide with surprise. It seems like I startled her by accidentally tripping over her pile of books.*

Emi: "I'm so sorry! I didn't see you there. Are you okay?"

???: "O-oh, um, yes! I'm fine. I was just. . . lost in my books, so I didn't realize someone else entered the room. . ."

*The girl answers in a meek voice that is barely audible. It nearly takes all of my concentration to make out what she's saying.*

*I begin to collect the books scattered across the floor, stacking them neatly beside her.*

*Speaking in a gentle tone, I try my best to make her comfortable.*

Emi: "Don't worry about it, it's my fault for not looking where I was going!"

Emi: "Are you sure you're really alright? I didn't hurt you or anything?"

???: " That's okay, I was just a bit startled that's all."

???: "Thank you for helping with the books. I didn't realize anyone else would be here today. . ."

Emi: "Oh, I'm here to help dust the library as per Ingram's orders!"

Emi: "My name's Emi by the way. I recently started helping out around the cafe, so I'm relatively new around here."

???: "Ah, Ingram? Really? You're a friend of his?"

*Mentioning Ingram's name seems to have sparked something in the girl. Her eyes brighten with a newfound clarity.*

Emi: "Yeah, you could say that! He thought I could help pitch in with things around the cafe, so that's how I ended up here. Oh, and with spirit guiding too!"

???: "Could you be the new girl that Ingram was mentioning? You'll be staying at Yuugen House too then?"

Emi: "That's me! Sorry, but I don't think I caught your name?"

???: "Oh s-sorry! I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Annelise. It's nice to have another girl around."
 
*Annelise smiles timidly, feeling a tad more relaxed after realizing that I was a friend of Ingram's.*

Emi: "Alright, I won't disturb you from your reading too much then! I'll get right to cleaning, and you can go back to enjoying your book."

Annelise: "Okay, good luck with the cleaning. Let me know if you need any help."

*Annelise dives right back into her reading as I begin dusting on the other side of the library. I take the opportunity to tidy up the remaining books on the tables.*

*Fortunately, there isn't much dust to clean and I swiftly make my way through the bookshelves, ensuring to get into each nook and cranny.* 

*As I approach Annelise, I notice the pile of books beside her has grown.*

Emi: "(Is she planning to read those books? Or has she already finished them?)"
# Shelve books
Emi: "Hey Annelise, do you need some help putting those books away? You can toss them my way if you want!"

*Annelise looks up from her novel, her eyes sparkling as if I just read her mind. She eagerly nods in agreement.*

Annelise: "Yes, actually! I'm glad you asked, I got these books as a recommendation from Ingram, but I'm not tall enough to reach the shelf they came from."

Annelise: "I didn't want to bother him because he looked so busy. There have been customers all day, so I haven't found a good time to ask him about it. . ."

Emi: "That shouldn't be a problem! I'm here to tidy up the area anyways. Where do these books go?"

*Annelise looks away with a bit of a guilty look. She points to a spot near the very top of one of the bookshelves in the wall.*

Emi: "(Oh. . . that spot might be just out of my reach.)"

*I pause for a moment, pondering how to reach the shelf Annelise pointed to.*

Emi: "(I could ask Ingram, but then nobody would be around to deal with customers. And the chairs around here might not be tall enough.)"

Emi: "(I wonder if there's a ladder around that we could use. . .)"

Emi: "(Oh! There might be one in the back room. There are all sorts of things back there, so surely that includes a ladder.)"

Emi: "Just wait here Annelise! I'm going to check the back. There might be a ladder there that we can use."

Annelise: "That's a good idea! I'll be waiting then."

*I quickly rush out of the library and check the back room, shuffling through the cleaning supplies in search of anything that looks remotely like a step ladder.*

Emi: "(Hmm. . . I could've sworn there was one around here.)"

Emi: "(. . . Ah! There it is!)"

*My eyes spot a folded step ladder hidden behind one of the shelves. I make my way over and quickly grab it, brushing off any dust stuck to it.*

*With the ladder in hand, I head back to the library where Annelise is waiting.*

Emi: "I'm back! And look what I found!"

*As I show the ladder to Annelise, she looks at me in amazement and claps happily.*

Annelise: "Oh, there really was a ladder!"

Annelise: "You're amazing Emi! Now we can put the books away, and I don't have to keep hoarding them by my side."

*Annelise smiles gently as she rises to her feet, carrying the stack of books over to me.*

*I set up the ladder and carefully take a step, making sure that I have solid footing before climbing up to the top.*

*Once I have a good view of the top shelf, I gesture for Annelise to pass me the books. She obliges, and we work through the stack slowly and methodically.*

Emi: "And that's the last one! Good work, thanks for helping me out!"

Annelise: "Oh no, it's my pleasure! If anything, I'm indebted to you."

Annelise: "I didn't have the heart to burden you while you were dusting the shelves, so I really appreciate that you were willing to help. . ."

*Annelise twiddles with her fingers, a little flustered by my compliment.*

Emi: "(Is she not used to compliments? She's pretty shy huh. . .)"

Emi: "Are you a big reader? I couldn't help but notice that we put away quite a few books."

Emi: "Did you read them all today?"

Annelise: "Eh? Ah yes, I really enjoy reading. I usually get so immersed in the story that I often tune out of reality."

Emi: "That sounds fun! It's almost as if you're travelling to an entirely different dimension."

Annelise: "Yes, that's exactly how it feels!"

Annelise: "Imagining what could happen if I did certain things differently than the main character feels wondrous."

Emi: "Do you have a favourite book?"

Annelise: "I do! Let me go grab it and show you!"

*Annelise's face brightens at the mention of discussing her favourite book. Her eyes shine with joy, and a radiant smile spreads across her face.*

*Filled with cheerful spirit, she skips over to a nearby bookshelf in a capricious, graceful manner, like she's floating on air.*

*She picks out a small novel, handling it with a gentle touch as she returns.*

*She presents the book to me, holding it out like a precious treasure. There's an air of pride and joy about her, reminiscent of an adorable child showing off their favourite toy.*

*It's like the timid girl I encountered earlier has disappeared completely.* 

Annelise: "This is it! It's called Hiraeth, and I highly recommend it."

Annelise: "It's about a young artist named Elara. She experiences these extraordinary dreams where she visits a mystical land called Hiraeth, filled with enchanting mysteries and sights as far as the eye can see."

Emi: "That sounds fascinating! What do you like about it?"

Annelise: "I really admire Elara's strength!" 

Annelise: "Despite being a struggling artist with lots of challenges to overcome, she manages to find inspiration in her journeys to Hiraeth."

Annelise: "Each new discovery she comes across fuels her creativity, leading to her next big artistic breakthrough!"

Annelise: "I aspire to be as courageous as her one day. Her adventures sound so exhilarating!"

*I can't help but smile at Annelise's enthusiasm as she gushes about the novel.*

*She notices my smile, and realizes she's been chatting non-stop for a while. She suddenly stops, cutting herself off.*

Annelise: "Ah, sorry! I'm probably boring you with all of this. . ."

Emi: "No, not at all! I enjoyed listening to you talk! If anything, it makes me want to read the book too."

*Just then, a small piece of paper slips out from the book, floating gently to the ground between us.*

*As I bend down to pick it up, Annelise quickly snatches it before I can. I look up at her, noticing a faint blush on her cheeks.*

Emi: "Oh, is everything okay?"

Annelise: "Huh? Oh, yes, it's nothing. . ."

Annelise: "I just. . . I sometimes like to sketch too. It's embarrassing, so I'd prefer if you don't tell anybody else about it."

Emi: "Oh, I understand! Your secret is safe with me."

*Annelise visibly relaxes, breathing a sigh of relief. It seems she's a bit shy about sharing her art with others.*

Emi: "Alright! I'll have to get back to doing chores soon, or else Ingram will come looking for me."

Emi: "Would you like anything to drink? You've been talking for a while, so maybe a refresher might help?"

*Annelise shakes her head, holding Hiraeth close to her chest.*

Annelise: "No thank you, I think I'm okay! Thank you for asking though."

Emi: "Alright, sounds good. If you need anything, just let me know!"

Emi: "I really have to go now, but it was nice meeting you."

Emi: "Let's talk more about books when we're back at Yuugen House!"

Annelise: "Yes, of course! I'd be more than happy to."

*Annelise bows slightly, a smile lighting up her face.*

*I return the smile and wave as I exit the library, leaving her to her reading.*

Emi: "(That was pleasant! I didn't expect Annelise to be such a passionate book lover. Now I'm really curious about Hiraeth.)"

Emi: "(I'll have to ask her for more recommendations later.)"

# Continue dusting
*I decide to leave Annelise alone, figuring that she probably just found more books to read.*

*Eventually, I manage to finish dusting all the shelves in no time.*

Emi: "(Hmm, somehow that felt a lot quicker than I expected. . .)"

*I glance over at Annelise, who hasn't moved an inch since we conversed earlier.*

*She has yet to notice that I finished dusting the shelves.*

Emi: "(That book pile is really growing by the minute. . .)"

*I decide to approach Annelise, curious about the books sitting beside her.*

Emi: "Annelise, are you a big reader? I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a few books in your pile."

Emi: "That's a lot to read in one day, isn't it?"

*Annelise snaps back to reality as she looks up from her book, surprised by my question. It seems she wasn't expecting me to make conversation with her.*

Annelise: "Eh? Ah yes, I really enjoy reading. I usually get so immersed in the story that I often tune out of reality."

Annelise: "When that happens, time just flies right by."

Emi: "That sounds fun! It's almost as if you're time travelling."

Annelise: ". . .!"

Annelise: "Yes, that's exactly how it feels!"

Annelise: "Imagining what could happen if I did certain things differently than the main character feels wondrous."

*Annelise perks up, suddenly more engaged in the conversation. She must be excited to talk about what she's reading.*

Emi: "So what are you currently reading? You seem so focused on it."

Emi: "Is it a good story?"

Annelise: "Oh, this is my favourite book! Let me show you."

*Annelise's face brightens at the mention of the book she's reading. Her eyes shine with joy, and a radiant smile spreads across her face.*

*Filled with cheerful spirit, she rises to her feet and skips over in a capricious, graceful manner, like she's floating on air.*

*She presents the book to me, holding it out like a precious treasure. There's an air of pride and joy about her, reminiscent of an adorable child showing off their favourite toy.*

*It's like the timid girl I encountered earlier has disappeared completely.* 

Annelise: "Here, it's called Hiraeth. It may not look very interesting at first glance, but I highly recommend it!"

Annelise: "It's about a young artist named Elara. She experiences these extraordinary dreams where she visits a mystical land called Hiraeth, filled with enchanting mysteries and sights as far as the eye can see."

Emi: "That sounds fascinating! What do you like about it?"
