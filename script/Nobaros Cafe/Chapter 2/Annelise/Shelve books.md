# Shelve books
Emi: "Hey Annelise, do you need some help putting those books away? You can toss them my way if you want!"

*Annelise looks up from her novel, her eyes sparkling as if I just read her mind. She eagerly nods in agreement.*

Annelise: "Yes, actually! I'm glad you asked, I got these books as a recommendation from Ingram, but I'm not tall enough to reach the shelf they came from."

Annelise: "I didn't want to bother him because he looked so busy. There have been customers all day, so I haven't found a good time to ask him about it. . ."

Emi: "That shouldn't be a problem! I'm here to tidy up the area anyways. Where do these books go?"

*Annelise looks away with a bit of a guilty look. She points to a spot near the very top of one of the bookshelves in the wall.*

Emi: "(Oh. . . that spot might be just out of my reach.)"

*I pause for a moment, pondering how to reach the shelf Annelise pointed to.*

Emi: "(I could ask Ingram, but then nobody would be around to deal with customers. And the chairs around here might not be tall enough.)"

Emi: "(I wonder if there's a ladder around that we could use. . .)"

Emi: "(Oh! There might be one in the back room. There are all sorts of things back there, so surely that includes a ladder.)"

Emi: "Just wait here Annelise! I'm going to check the back. There might be a ladder there that we can use."

Annelise: "That's a good idea! I'll be waiting then."

*I quickly rush out of the library and check the back room, shuffling through the cleaning supplies in search of anything that looks remotely like a step ladder.*

Emi: "(Hmm. . . I could've sworn there was one around here.)"

Emi: "(. . . Ah! There it is!)"

*My eyes spot a folded step ladder hidden behind one of the shelves. I make my way over and quickly grab it, brushing off any dust stuck to it.*

*With the ladder in hand, I head back to the library where Annelise is waiting.*

Emi: "I'm back! And look what I found!"

*As I show the ladder to Annelise, she looks at me in amazement and claps happily.*

Annelise: "Oh, there really was a ladder!"

Annelise: "You're amazing Emi! Now we can put the books away, and I don't have to keep hoarding them by my side."

*Annelise smiles gently as she rises to her feet, carrying the stack of books over to me.*

*I set up the ladder and carefully take a step, making sure that I have solid footing before climbing up to the top.*

*Once I have a good view of the top shelf, I gesture for Annelise to pass me the books. She obliges, and we work through the stack slowly and methodically.*

Emi: "And that's the last one! Good work, thanks for helping me out!"

Annelise: "Oh no, it's my pleasure! If anything, I'm indebted to you."

Annelise: "I didn't have the heart to burden you while you were dusting the shelves, so I really appreciate that you were willing to help. . ."

*Annelise twiddles with her fingers, a little flustered by my compliment.*

Emi: "(Is she not used to compliments? She's pretty shy huh. . .)"

Emi: "Are you a big reader? I couldn't help but notice that we put away quite a few books."

Emi: "Did you read them all today?"

Annelise: "Eh? Ah yes, I really enjoy reading. I usually get so immersed in the story that I often tune out of reality."

Emi: "That sounds fun! It's almost as if you're travelling to an entirely different dimension."

Annelise: "Yes, that's exactly how it feels!"

Annelise: "Imagining what could happen if I did certain things differently than the main character feels wondrous."

Emi: "Do you have a favourite book?"

Annelise: "I do! Let me go grab it and show you!"

*Annelise's face brightens at the mention of discussing her favourite book. Her eyes shine with joy, and a radiant smile spreads across her face.*

*Filled with cheerful spirit, she skips over to a nearby bookshelf in a capricious, graceful manner, like she's floating on air.*

*She picks out a small novel, handling it with a gentle touch as she returns.*

*She presents the book to me, holding it out like a precious treasure. There's an air of pride and joy about her, reminiscent of an adorable child showing off their favourite toy.*

*It's like the timid girl I encountered earlier has disappeared completely.* 

Annelise: "This is it! It's called Hiraeth, and I highly recommend it."

Annelise: "It's about a young artist named Elara. She experiences these extraordinary dreams where she visits a mystical land called Hiraeth, filled with enchanting mysteries and sights as far as the eye can see."

Emi: "That sounds fascinating! What do you like about it?"

Annelise: "I really admire Elara's strength!" 

Annelise: "Despite being a struggling artist with lots of challenges to overcome, she manages to find inspiration in her journeys to Hiraeth."

Annelise: "Each new discovery she comes across fuels her creativity, leading to her next big artistic breakthrough!"

Annelise: "I aspire to be as courageous as her one day. Her adventures sound so exhilarating!"

*I can't help but smile at Annelise's enthusiasm as she gushes about the novel.*

*She notices my smile, and realizes she's been chatting non-stop for a while. She suddenly stops, cutting herself off.*

Annelise: "Ah, sorry! I'm probably boring you with all of this. . ."

Emi: "No, not at all! I enjoyed listening to you talk! If anything, it makes me want to read the book too."

*Just then, a small piece of paper slips out from the book, floating gently to the ground between us.*

*As I bend down to pick it up, Annelise quickly snatches it before I can. I look up at her, noticing a faint blush on her cheeks.*

Emi: "Oh, is everything okay?"

Annelise: "Huh? Oh, yes, it's nothing. . ."

Annelise: "I just. . . I sometimes like to sketch too. It's embarrassing, so I'd prefer if you don't tell anybody else about it."

Emi: "Oh, I understand! Your secret is safe with me."

*Annelise visibly relaxes, breathing a sigh of relief. It seems she's a bit shy about sharing her art with others.*

Emi: "Alright! I'll have to get back to doing chores soon, or else Ingram will come looking for me."

Emi: "Would you like anything to drink? You've been talking for a while, so maybe a refresher might help?"

*Annelise shakes her head, holding Hiraeth close to her chest.*

Annelise: "No thank you, I think I'm okay! Thank you for asking though."

Emi: "Alright, sounds good. If you need anything, just let me know!"

Emi: "I really have to go now, but it was nice meeting you."

Emi: "Let's talk more about books when we're back at Yuugen House!"

Annelise: "Yes, of course! I'd be more than happy to."

*Annelise bows slightly, a smile lighting up her face.*

*I return the smile and wave as I exit the library, leaving her to her reading.*

Emi: "(That was pleasant! I didn't expect Annelise to be such a passionate book lover. Now I'm really curious about Hiraeth.)"

Emi: "(I'll have to ask her for more recommendations later.)"
