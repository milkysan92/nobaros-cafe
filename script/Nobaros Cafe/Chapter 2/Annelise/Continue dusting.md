# Continue dusting
*I decide to leave Annelise alone, figuring that she probably just found more books to read.*

*Eventually, I manage to finish dusting all the shelves in no time.*

Emi: "(Hmm, somehow that felt a lot quicker than I expected. . .)"

*I glance over at Annelise, who hasn't moved an inch since we conversed earlier.*

*She has yet to notice that I finished dusting the shelves.*

Emi: "(That book pile is really growing by the minute. . .)"

*I decide to approach Annelise, curious about the books sitting beside her.*

Emi: "Annelise, are you a big reader? I couldn't help but notice that you have quite a few books in your pile."

Emi: "That's a lot to read in one day, isn't it?"

*Annelise snaps back to reality as she looks up from her book, surprised by my question. It seems she wasn't expecting me to make conversation with her.*

Annelise: "Eh? Ah yes, I really enjoy reading. I usually get so immersed in the story that I often tune out of reality."

Annelise: "When that happens, time just flies right by."

Emi: "That sounds fun! It's almost as if you're time travelling."

Annelise: ". . .!"

Annelise: "Yes, that's exactly how it feels!"

Annelise: "Imagining what could happen if I did certain things differently than the main character feels wondrous."

*Annelise perks up, suddenly more engaged in the conversation. She must be excited to talk about what she's reading.*

Emi: "So what are you currently reading? You seem so focused on it."

Emi: "Is it a good story?"

Annelise: "Oh, this is my favourite book! Let me show you."

*Annelise's face brightens at the mention of the book she's reading. Her eyes shine with joy, and a radiant smile spreads across her face.*

*Filled with cheerful spirit, she rises to her feet and skips over in a capricious, graceful manner, like she's floating on air.*

*She presents the book to me, holding it out like a precious treasure. There's an air of pride and joy about her, reminiscent of an adorable child showing off their favourite toy.*

*It's like the timid girl I encountered earlier has disappeared completely.* 

Annelise: "Here, it's called Hiraeth. It may not look very interesting at first glance, but I highly recommend it!"

Annelise: "It's about a young artist. She experiences these extraordinary dreams where she visits a mystical land called Hiraeth, filled with enchanting mysteries and sights as far as the eye can see."

Emi: "That sounds fascinating! What do you like about it?"

Annelise: "I really admire her strength!" 

Annelise: "Despite being a struggling artist with lots of challenges to overcome, she manages to find inspiration in her journeys to Hiraeth."

Annelise: "Each new discovery she comes across fuels her creativity, leading to her next big artistic breakthrough!"

Annelise: "I aspire to be as courageous as her one day. Her adventures sound so exhilarating!"

*I can't help but smile at Annelise's enthusiasm as she gushes about the novel.*

*She notices my smile, and realizes she's been chatting non-stop for a while. She suddenly stops, cutting herself off.*

Annelise: "Ah, sorry! I'm probably boring you with all of this. . ."

Emi: "No, not at all! I enjoyed listening to you talk! If anything, it makes me want to read the book too."

*Just then, a small piece of paper slips out from the book, floating gently to the ground between us.*

*As I bend down to pick it up, Annelise quickly snatches it before I can. I look up at her, noticing a faint blush on her cheeks.*

Emi: "Oh, is everything okay?"

Annelise: "Huh? Oh, yes, it's nothing. . ."

Annelise: "I just. . . I sometimes like to sketch too. It's embarrassing, so I'd prefer if you don't tell anybody else about it."

Emi: "Oh, I understand! Your secret is safe with me."

*Annelise visibly relaxes, breathing a sigh of relief. It seems she's a bit shy about sharing her art with others.*

Emi: "Alright! I'll have to get back to doing chores soon, or else Ingram will come looking for me."

Emi: "Would you like anything to drink? You've been talking for a while, so maybe a refresher might help?"

*Annelise shakes her head, holding Hiraeth close to her chest.*

Annelise: "No thank you, I think I'm okay! Thank you for asking though."

Emi: "Alright, sounds good. If you need anything, just let me know!"

Emi: "I really have to go now, but it was nice meeting you."

Emi: "Let's talk more about books when we're back at Yuugen House!"

Annelise: "Yes, of course! I'd be more than happy to."

*Annelise bows slightly, a smile lighting up her face.*

*I return the smile and wave as I exit the library, leaving her to her reading.*

Emi: "(That was pleasant! I didn't expect Annelise to be such a passionate book lover. Now I'm really curious about Hiraeth.)"

Emi: "(I'll have to ask her for more recommendations later.)"
