Emi: "Let's go clean up some empty dishes."

*I grab a few of the neatly folded rags and head back out to the cafe floor.*

*Starting at the table closest to me, I gingerly gather the dirty dishes, stacking plates and cups on top of each other.*

*Once the dishes are cleared, I swiftly wipe down the table of the surface with a rag. As I progress, the pure white look of the rag turns discoloured from all the spills and crumbs.*

Emi: "Hm? Isn't that. . ."

*In the corner of the cafe, a familiar figure lounges around with an espresso in his hand, basking in the sunlight shining through the window.*

Emi: "(It's Akira! He's the one I ran into back at Yuugen House the other night.)"

*Unlike when we first conversed, the rose-brown hue of his eyes is now hidden behind a pair of rectangular frames. His sun-kissed hair is neatly styled, a few golden locks tucked behind his ear. He also dons a business casual look, with a green blazer draped over the shoulders of his black dress shirt.*

*He sets down his espresso, resting his face on a hand as he observes the scenery outside the window. There's a nonchalant vibe to him, seeming like he could fall asleep anytime. It would be an understatement to say he's a handsome looking guy.*

Emi: "(. . .!!)"

Emi: "(What am I doing?!)"

Emi: "(Snap out of it Emi! You're in the middle of working. Stop ogling at him before he catches you!)"

*Just then, I accidentally lock eyes with Akira. He recognizes me immediately, and waves hello with a gentle smile. He gestures for me to come over.*

Emi: "(He didn't catch me staring just now, did he?)"

*I swallow my pride and make my way over to him, pretending that I just noticed him. Akira greets me with a kind smile, fixing his posture as I approach the table.*

Akira: "Hello, we meet again. You're Emi, right? I believe we met back at Yuugen House the other night." 

Emi: "Y-yes, I remember you. I think you said your name is Akira?"

Emi: "(Why am I stammering!? I need to calm the heck down.)"

Akira: "Bingo, you've got the right guy."

Akira: "Are you busy? It's a lovely day out, and it'd be nice to chat with someone to pass the time."

*A small voice at the back of my mind tempts me to join Akira.*

Emi: "Oh, sorry, I'm in the middle of doing something. I need to collect some empty dishes and clean tables."

Akira: "Ah, is that so? So Ingram has already assigned you a fair amount of chores to work on, huh?"

*Akira shifts his gaze and looks behind me, scouring the cafe. As he observes the other tables, I peek at the espresso cup in front of him. There is just a tiny bit left, probably just a sip's worth remaining.*

*Akira notices my gaze, and holds the espresso cup in his hands. He looks up with another smile.*

Akira: "It looks like everyone else is still in the middle of conversation. I'm almost finished my espresso, so why don't you take a small break and give me some company until then?"

Akira: "That way, you'll be a little more rested up and have an empty dish to bring back with you. Kills two birds with one stone, doesn't it?"

*Akira folds his hands, quite proud of his little offer. He sounds quite convincing and the little voice in my head tempts me further.*
