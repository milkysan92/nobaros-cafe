# Maple grove

CH2_Emi: "You know what, let's go check out the maple trees!"

CH2_Emi: "If that's what your heart wants, then I don't see why not. We're here to enjoy ourselves too after all!"

Izumi: ". . .! Yes, let's go!"

Izumi: "I think the maple trees are this way. I saw lots of people headed in that direction."

CH2_Emi: "Sounds good, let's get going then."

*Izumi hurries to pack up our lunches, closing them up in a matter of seconds. His eagerness gives me hope that I made the right decision.*

*Soon, we're on our feet, ready to try something new for the photoshoot.*

*After some walking, we eventually arrive at a shrine. There's noticeably a larger crowd here compared to the open area where we ate lunch.*

*Several families and couples loiter around, happily chattering amongst themselves under the crimson red of the maple trees.*

Izumi: "So many maple trees. . ."

*Seeing the sparkles in Izumi's eyes brings a smile to my face.*

*Although he doesn't say much at the sight of the grove, his body language speaks volumes about how much he's been looking forward to this.*

*He steps forward eagerly, his gaze sweeping over the vibrant hues of the maple leaves with an almost childlike wonder.*

*There's a lightness to his movements, a sense of anticipation palpable in the way he takes in every detail of the scene before him.*

CH2_Emi: "(Who's the one that's excited now?)"

*I can't help but chuckle at his giddiness.*

*Just then, I feel a tug from below. Averting my gaze down to the edge of my coat, I find the same child that I ran into earlier, waving at me with a cheerful glee.*

CH2_Emi: "Ah! It's you again."

Haruto: "You're the miss who helped me earlier! Do you remember what my name is?"

CH2_Emi: "Of course, your name is Haruto, right?"
 
*He smiles brighter and nods excitedly, sticking a hand out at me.*

Haruto: "You're right! Here's your reward, a high five!"

CH2_Emi: "(Aww, how cute! What a good kid.)"

*I return his smile, crouching down to his level and playfully high-fiving him. He giggles, clearly delighted by our interaction.*
 
CH2_Emi: "Where are your grandparents? Did you run off again?"

Haruto: "No, grandpa and grandma are just sitting over there! They told me I could run around and play as long as they could see me."

*He points towards the shrine, where his grandparents are sitting comfortably on a wooden bench. As I glance over in their direction, they seem to recognize me and wave amicably.*

Izumi: "Sis, I think I found a nice spot to snap some photos!"

Izumi: "Eh? Who's this kid?"

CH2_Emi: "Ah, Izumi! This is-"

Haruto: "Wow, that's such a big camera!"

Izumi: "E-eh?!"

*Suddenly, Haruto gets right up in Izumi's face, fascinated by his camera. The unexpected attention flusters Izumi, leaving him momentarily unsure of how to respond.*

Haruto: "Mister, is that your camera? It looks so cool!"

Izumi: "Y-yes, that's right. Do you want to see it up close?"

Haruto: "Really? Can I?!"

Izumi: "Sure, just be careful not to touch it, or it might get dirty."

Izumi: "Here, I'll give you a closer look."

*Izumi squats down to Haruto's level, carefully holding the camera for him to see. I watch as Haruto's eyes widen with curiosity and excitement.*

Izumi: "This here is the lens, where the light comes in to take the picture. And this part is the viewfinder, where you look through to frame your shot."

*He begins to explain how the camera works, pointing to each part while mentioning what they're for. Haruto listens intently, completely absorbed in Izumi's explanation.*

Izumi: "These buttons help control different settings. See this one? It adjusts the shutter speed, which can make your pictures brighter or darker."

*As Izumi talks, his face lights up with a heartwarming smile. It's clear that he's enjoying himself, and I can't help but feel a wave of joy at the sight.*

CH2_Emi: "(He really is passionate about his craft.)"

Haruto: "Whoa, that's amazing! You know so much mister!"

Izumi: "Ah, it's nothing special. You learn these things over time."

Haruto: "Are you going to take pictures of the big red trees? Can you take a picture of me too?"

UK_generic: "Now now, that's enough Haruto. You're bothering the poor man."

Haruto: "Grandpa! Grandma!"

*Just then, Haruto's grandparents come into view, their faces breaking into wide smiles at the sight of him. With a joyful shout, he runs straight into their open arms, and they embrace him lovingly.*

Grandma: "I'm so sorry to bother you again young lady. We're supposed to be babysitting him at the moment, but as you can tell, it's not the easiest task trying to keep up with him at our age."

Grandma: "Judging from the smile on his face, I think he's taken a liking to you."

CH2_Emi: "Haha, he's a very cheerful kid! Don't worry too much about being a bother, It was lovely running into you guys again."

Izumi: "Again. . .? Do you know these people sis?"

CH2_Emi: "Ah, yes, I forgot to introduce you! We met when I was checking out the waterfall earlier. I saved their grandson from falling into the stream."

Izumi: "What? You should've told me earlier!"

Izumi: "Are you okay? You didn't hurt yourself, did you?"

CH2_Emi: "Relax, I'm alright! It was no big deal."

Grandpa: "That's an impressive looking camera you've got there! Are you a photographer?"

Izumi: "Huh? Yes,  that's right. I post my photos on a blog that my sister manages on social media."

Grandma: "Oh, how wonderful! A sibling duo! What kind of photos do you take?"

Izumi: "Ah, I can show you some of my pictures. I usually take landscape or animal photos."

Haruto: "Mister, can I see too?"

Izumi: "Haha, of course, just give me a second."

*Izumi takes out his phone, flipping through blog posts as he showcases his photos to the three of them.*

Grandpa: "Oh wow, those are some real nice photos you got there, young man! You're real talented."

Izumi: "Th-thank you, I appreciate the compliment."

*Izumi rubs the back of his head, a little embarrassed from the old man's praise.*

Izumi: "Actually, if it's okay with you, I was wondering if you'd like to model to be in some of those pictures."

Izumi: "My sister actually suggested that I try doing portraits and headshots to change things up a little bit."

CH2_Emi: "That's right! We actually came here looking to shoot with the maple trees as a nice background."

Grandma: "Of course! We'd be delighted for you to take our picture."

Haruto: "Yeah, I like your photos a lot, I wanna be in them too!"

Izumi: ". . .!"

Izumi: "Thank you so much!"

*Izumi's face lights up as soon as he receives their permission.*

*He scours the area for a moment, until his eyes land on a grand maple tree shrouded in sunlight in a lone corner of the shrine.*

Izumi: "Could I have you guys stand over there? I think that maple tree might make for a very nice backdrop."

*As Izumi directs the three of them to the tree, I can't help but follow behind with a warm feeling in my heart.*

*The three of them gather closely, standing proud and tall under the tree's branches while Izumi stands at a distance, assessing the scene's aesthetic.*

*With a gentle voice, he instructs them to adjust their poses and tilt their heads slightly.*

*After some adjustments, Izumi begins snapping various headshots and portraits of them. His eyes are filled with concentration, completely focused on capturing the perfect shot.* 

*During the little photoshoot, I watch Izumi closely as he interacts with the family.*

*His movements are deliberate and confident, with each adjustment and click of the shutter demonstrating his expertise. The disappointed look from earlier has completely vanished, replaced by immense love and passion for his craft.*

CH2_Emi: "(He's really enjoying himself. I'm glad I consulted Ingram earlier.)"

*After taking some stellar shots, Izumi shows them to the family. Upon seeing the pictures, their faces glow with happy smiles, brimming with joy.*

Grandma: "These pictures came out wonderfully dear, don't you think?"

Grandpa: ". . .Yes, they did."

CH2_Emi: "Eh? Sir, are you okay?"

*The old man starts welling up with tears, surrounded by his wife and grandson. Izumi and I look at each other, unsure of what to do.*

*Izumi digs through his bag, finding some pocket tissues that he offers to the old man, who graciously accepts.*

Haruto: "Grandpa, are you okay? Does it hurt somewhere?"

Grandpa: "No, I'm okay. Sorry, I just. . ."

Grandpa: "I felt so moved after seeing your photo. . ."

Grandma: "There, there. Keep it together, you old sap."

*The old lady consoles her husband, gently patting his back as he wipes away his tears. After a moment, she turns towards us with a warm, grateful smile, her eyes glistening with emotion.*

Grandma: "You see, we're getting up there in age. Our health hasn't been the best, especially for my husband who needs to visit the hospital quite often."

Grandma: "Because of that, we haven't been able to go out with our grandson in a long time."

Grandma: "This trip is the first time in a while that we've been able to do so."

Grandma: "And it might be one of the last times we'll get to spend with our grandson because we live so far away."

Grandma: "So we're happy that today's trip can be saved through those photos you took."

Grandma: "One day, Haruto will grow up into a fine man, and there's a chance he might not even remember us at that point."

Grandma: "But pictures don't lie. If he sees these pictures again, it might remind him of the time we spent together."

Izumi: "The memories that the photo carries. . ."

Grandma: "Could I bother you to share these photos with us, dear?"

Izumi: "Huh? Oh yes, for sure!"

*As Izumi figures out how to share the photos with the grandparents, a tender feeling fills my heart. He seems to be more animated than before.*

*We eventually say goodbye to the family and begin to head home.*

*As we're walking, I notice Izumi's fixated gaze on his camera, lost in thought.*

CH2_Emi: "Izumi?"

Izumi: ". . .Huh? Oh, did you call out to me, sis? What's the matter?"

CH2_Emi: "You've been staring at the family portraits you took earlier. Is something about them that's bugging you?"

Izumi: "No, it's not that. If anything, I think these pictures are different."

CH2_Emi: "Oh? Different how?"

Izumi: "Talking to the family from earlier made me realize that what I was looking for wasn't a beautiful composition or an extraordinary subject."

Izumi: "But rather, I was searching for a deeper meaning behind my photography."

Izumi: "Before, I always aimed to capture the beauty of the moment."

Izumi: "But that made my photos feel empty, like there was no soul in them. They were just studies of the real world."

Izumi: "But these family portraits. . .there's a meaning attached to them. There's a whole story behind how they came to be."

Izumi: "I wasn't just taking photos of people as subjects. I was capturing a moment of their lives, a precious memory."

Izumi: "When they told me how much these photos meant to them, it made me feel glad that I became a photographer. I could help them preserve their memories."

Izumi: ". . .Thanks for taking me on this trip, Himari. I really like how these turned out."

CH2_Emi: "I'm happy to hear that you managed to figure out what your missing something was."

*Izumi looks at me with a sincere smile, the happiest he's been all day.*

*Seeing him this content, realizing that his passion has evolved into something more profound, fills me with a sense of joy.*

Izumi: "Actually, can I ask you for one more favour?"

CH2_Emi: "Hmm? What is it?"

Izumi: "I want to take a picture together."

CH2_Emi: "Eh? All of a sudden?"

Izumi: "Well, in the same vein, we should take pictures of ourselves too."

*Izumi whips out his phone and opens the front-facing camera, gesturing closer to me before I realize what's going on.*

Izumi: "Alright, look at this spot here! Say cheese in 3. . .2 . . ."

CH2_Emi: "W-wait! I haven't come up with a pose yet!"

Izumi: "Just smile, sis. Don't overthink it."

CH2_Emi: "B-but-!"

Izumi: "1. . ."

Izumi: "Camera's about to go off!"

*In the blink of an eye, I strike the first pose that comes to mind.*

Izumi: ". . .Cheese!"

*. . .*

Emi: ". . ."

Ingram: "Welcome back. It's all done now."

Emi: "Hmm. . .?"

*I slowly open my eyes, seeing Ingram standing right in front of me.*

Emi: "I'm back. . ."

Ingram: "You did a good job back there. How did everything go?"

Emi: "It was a big success!"

Emi: "In the end, he managed to find his purpose as a photographer."

Emi: "Ah, but it was all thanks to your advice earlier! When you suggested taking pictures of people instead, it really helped."

Ingram: "Is that so? I'm glad to hear things worked out."

Emi: "Yeah, we ended up taking portraits of an old couple with their grandson. Izumi was really cool when he was instructing them on what to do."

Ingram: "Well, it is a childhood hobby turned into a professional career after all. I imagine he was right in his element."

Emi: "He definitely seemed to enjoy himself. I'm glad we were able to help him pass on with happy memories."

Emi: "Makes me curious about what's in store for me later, when I start remembering parts of my life in the real world."

Ingram: "Who knows? But as you continue spirit guiding, you'll be going through other people's memories a lot."

Ingram: "With that much exposure, I'm sure there'll be a good chance that it'll help jog your own memories to return."

Ingram: "Well then, it's late now. We should head back home and join the others for dinner before it gets dark."

Emi: "That's a good idea, I'm starved!"

Emi: ". . .Huh?"

*Just as I'm about to follow Ingram home, I suddenly hear a faint hum from behind me. Turning around, I manage to catch a glimpse of a pulse of light being emitted from the mirror.*

*A small ball of light pops out of the mirror, descending slowly in the air like an angel's  feather.*

*I catch the little light in my hands and it fades upon contact, revealing a photograph within.*

Emi: "(Huh, it turned out pretty well in the end!)"

*I feel a smile forming as I stare at the selfie that Izumi and I took earlier.*

*In the end, all I managed was a simple smile and a peace sign in the nick of time. Izumi, on the other hand, has the biggest grin on his face, his eyes wrinkling from how much he's smiling.*

Emi: "(Rest in peace, Izumi. I'm sure your sister would be very proud of what you achieved here.)"

*I decide to hold onto the photograph, carrying Izumi's legacy with me.*

Emi: "Ingram, w-wait for me!"

Emi: "How are you so far already?"

Ingram: "I'm just walking at a normal speed."

Emi: "Well then, slow down! My legs aren't as long as yours."

Ingram: "You'll catch up in time."
