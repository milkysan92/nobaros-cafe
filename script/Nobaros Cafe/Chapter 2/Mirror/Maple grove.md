# Maple grove

Emi: "You know what, let's go check out the maple trees!"

Emi: "If that's what your heart wants, then I don't see why not. We're here to enjoy ourselves too after all!"

Izumi: ". . .! Yes, let's go!"

Izumi: "I think the maple trees are this way. I saw lots of people headed in that direction."

*Izumi hurries to pack up our lunches, closing them up in a matter of seconds. His eagerness reassures me that this is the right decision to make. Whether or not he's able to take a photo he's satisfied with is another matter though.*

*As we walk in the direction of the maple tree grove, the trees becomes increasingly stained in red. Soon, we arrive at a shrine. There's noticeably much more of a crowd here in comparison to the open area where we ate lunch. Several families and couples loiter around, happily chattering amongst each other under the crimson red of the maple trees.*

Izumi: "So many maple trees. . ."

*Seeing the sparkles in Izumi's eyes brings a smile to my face. Although Izumi doesn't actually say much at the sight of the grove, his body language shows just how much he'd been looking forward to this.*

Emi: "(Who's the one that's excited now?)"

UK_generic: "Whoa!! You have such a big camera sir! Are you a photographer?"

Izumi: "Eh? Y-yes, that's right."

*Suddenly, a child appears in front of Izumi, ogling his camera. The sudden attention flusters Izumi, and he doesn't know how to respond. The child doesn't seem to register Izumi's reaction though, and he continues interrogating him.*

UK_generic: "Amazing! Are you here to take photos of the big red trees too? Can you take a picture of me too?"

UK_generic: "Now now, that's enough Haruto. You're bothering the poor man."

Haruto: "Grandpa! Grandma!"

*Just then, an elderly couple comes into view, and the young child runs into their arms.*

Haruto's grandma: "I'm so sorry about that. We're babysitting our grandson at the moment, but he ran off before we could catch up to him."

Izumi: "Ah, don't worry about it. I was just flustered all of a sudden, that's all."

Izumi: ". . ."

Izumi: "Actually, if I may, would it be okay for me to take some photos of you with your grandson?"

Izumi: "I post my photos on an online blog that my sister here manages, and I'm looking to try out snapping some photos of people."

Izumi: "If it's okay with you, then I was wondering if you'd like to model to be in some of those pictures?"

*Izumi takes out his phone, showing the child and his grandparents the photography blog.*

Haruto's grandpa: "Oh wow, those are some real nice photos you got there young man! You're real talented."

Haruto's grandma: "We'd be delighted for you to take some pictures of us."

Haruto: "Yeah, I wanna get my picture taken too!"

Izumi: ". . .!"

Izumi: "Thank you so much!"

*Izumi's face lights up as soon as he receives the couple's permission. He scours the area for a moment, until his eyes land on a grand maple tree shrouded in sunlight in a lone corner of the shrine.*

Izumi: "Could I have you guys stand over there? I think that maple tree might make for a very nice backdrop."

*As Izumi directs the three of them to the tree, I can't help but follow behind with a warm feeling in my heart. As Izumi begins snapping various headshots and portraits of them, his eyes are filled with concentration rather than the disappointed look from earlier.*

Emi: "(He's really enjoying himself. I'm glad I consulted Ingram earlier.)"

*After taking some stellar shots, Izumi shows them to the family. Upon seeing the pictures, their faces glow with happy smiles, brimming with joy.*

Haruto's grandma: "These pictures came out wonderfully dear, don't you think so?"

Haruto's grandpa: ". . .Yes, they did."

Emi: "Eh? Sir, are you okay?"

*The grandpa starts welling up with tears, surrounded by his wife and grandson. Izumi and I look at each other, unsure of what to do. Izumi digs through his bag, finding some pocket tissues that he offers to the grandpa, who graciously accepts.*

Haruto's grandpa: "Sorry, I just felt so moved after seeing this picture. . ."

Haruto's grandma: "You see, we're getting up there in age and our health hasn't been the best it could be, especially for my husband who needs to visit the hospital quite often. We haven't been able to go out with our grandson in a long time because of that."

Haruto's grandma: "So this is the first time in a while that we've been able to go out. And maybe one of the last times we'll get to spend with our grandson because we live so far away from here."

Haruto's grandma: "So we're happy that this memory can be saved through those photos."

Haruto's grandma: "One day, Haruto will grow up into a fine man, and there's a chance he might not even remember us at that point."

Haruto's grandma: "But pictures don't lie. If he sees these pictures again, it might jog his memory and remember the time we spent together."

Izumi: "The memories that the photo carries. . ."

Haruto's grandma: "Could you share these photos with us dear?"

Izumi: "Huh? Oh yes, for sure!"

*As Izumi figures out how to share the photos with the grandparents, a tender feeling fills my heart. He seems to be more animated than before.*

*We eventually say goodbye to the family and begin to head home. As we're walking, I notice Izumi's fixated gaze on his camera, lost in thought.*

Emi: "Izumi?"

Izumi: ". . .Huh? Oh, did you call out to me sis? What's the matter?"

Emi: "You've been staring at the family portraits you took earlier. Is there something about them that's bugging you?"

Izumi: "No, it's not that. If anything, I think these pictures are different."

Izumi: "Talking to the family from earlier made me realize that what I was looking for wasn't a beautiful composition or an out-of-this-world subject."

Izumi: "But rather, I was searching for meaning behind my photography."

Izumi: "The feeling I got behind my other photos was emptiness. Although you told me they were beautiful to you, I couldn't help but feel like there was no soul in them. Like they were just a study of the real world."

Izumi: "But these family portraits. . .there's a meaning attached to them. There's a whole story behind how these pictures came to be."

Izumi: "I wasn't just taking pictures with people as a subject. I was capturing a moment of their life, a precious memory."

Izumi: "When they told me how much these photos meant to them, it made me feel glad that I became a photographer. That I could make them happy."

Izumi: "Thanks for taking me on this trip Himari. I actually like how these turned out quite a bit."

*Izumi looks at me with a sincere smile, the happiest he's been all day.*

Emi: "I'm happy to hear that you managed to figure out what your 'missing something' was."

Izumi: "Actually, can I ask you for one more favour?"

Emi: "Hmm? What is it?"

Izumi: "I want to take a picture together."

Emi: "Eh? All of a sudden?"

Izumi: "Well in the same vein, we should take pictures of ourselves too."

*Izumi whips out his phone, gesturing closer to me before I realize what's going on.*

Izumi: "Alright, look at this spot here! Say cheese in 3. . .2 . . ."

Emi: "W-wait! I haven't come up with a pose yet!"

Izumi: "Just smile sis, don't think too hard about it."

Emi: "B-but-!"

Izumi: "Camera's about to go off!"

*In the blink of an eye, I strike the first pose that comes to mind.*

Emi: ". . ."

Ingram: "Welcome back. It's all done now."

Emi: "Hmm. . .?"

*I slowly open my eyes, seeing Ingram standing right in front of me.*

Emi: "I'm back. . ."

Ingram: "You did a good job back there."

Emi: "Ah, it was thanks to your advice earlier! When you suggested taking pictures of people for a change of pace, it really helped."

Emi: "In the end, he manage to find his purpose as a photographer."

Emi: "It's really inspiring how diligent he was in turning a childhood hobby into a professional career!"

Emi: "Makes me curious about what's in store for me later, when I recover my own memories."

Ingram: "Who knows? But as you continue these spirit guiding missions, I'm sure there'll be a good chance that it'll help jog your memories to return."

Ingram: "Well then, it's late now. We should head back home and join the others for dinner before it gets dark."

Emi: "That's a good idea, I'm starved!"

*Just as I'm about to follow Ingram home, I suddenly hear a faint hum from behind me. Turning around, I manage to catch a glimpse of a pulse of light being emitted from the mirror.*

*A small ball of light pops out of the mirror, descending slowly in the air like an angel's  feather. I catch the little light in my hands and it fades upon contact, revealing a photograph within.*

Emi: "(Huh, it turned out pretty well in the end!)"

*I feel a smile forming as I stare at the photograph that Izumi and I took earlier. I decide to hold onto the photograph, carrying Izumi's legacy with me.*

Emi: "Ingram, w-wait for me! How are you so far already?"

Ingram: "I'm just walking at a normal speed."

Emi: "Well then, slow down! My legs aren't as long as yours."

Ingram: "You'll catch up in time."
