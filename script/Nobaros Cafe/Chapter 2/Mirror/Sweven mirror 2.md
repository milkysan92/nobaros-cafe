UK_generic: ". . .is."

UK_generic: ". . .Sis, wake up."

UK_generic: "We're supposed to head out soon."

UK_generic: ". . .Himari!"

SGM_Emi: ". . .!"

SGM_Emi: "Huh. . .?"

SGM_Emi: "Izumi?  Where am I?"

Izumi: "Sigh. . .finally, you're awake."

Izumi: "I've been trying to wake you up for an hour now."

SGM_Emi: "Eh? What's going on?"

Izumi: "Sis, did you forget that we were supposed to go on a trip today?"

SGM_Emi: "A trip?"

SGM_Emi: "(Is he talking about one of those photography trips he mentioned before?)"

SGM_Emi: "(And he keeps calling me sis. Does that mean I'm posing as his sister right now?)"

SGM_Emi: "(Hmm, let's play along for now.)"

CH2_Emi: "A-ahh, that's right! Sorry, I think I'm still half asleep."

CH2_Emi: "Can you remind me where we're headed?"

Izumi: "Sigh, you've got to stop staying up so late. . ."

Izumi: "We're supposed to head to Momiji Park. It's apparently quite scenic at this time of year."

Izumi: "Especially the maple trees at Momiji Shrine. It's a popular sightseeing spot, so there's probably going to be a bit of a crowd later." 

Izumi: "But despite all that, I'm looking forward to seeing them myself."

Izumi: "Anyways, now that you're awake, I'll wait downstairs while you get ready."

Izumi: "Just don't take too long. It takes around one to two hours to get there, so we should head out as soon as we can."

Izumi: "Otherwise, I'll just ditch you and head out myself."

*Izumi exits the room, closing the door with a solid thud behind him.* 

*I slowly sit up, stretching my arms towards the ceiling as a deep yawn escapes my mouth.*

*A hint of a sweet, floral scent blesses my nose, rousing me from my dazed state.*

CH2_Emi: "(Is that lavender?)"

*I look around for the source of the scent and spot some potted lavender plants on the windowsill. They're bathed in the morning rays filtering through the windows, casting an airy glow over the room.*

*In front of me, a wooden desk with a simple, minimalistic setup catches my eye. It features a few succulents, and a desk lamp designed like a calico cat.*

*Beside the desk is a floor-length mirror that doubles as a coat rack, with a few handbags hanging off its edge.*

*Pushing the covers out of the way, I leap out of bed and walk over to the mirror to examine myself.*

CH2_Emi: ". . .Eh?! Is this what I look like?"

*The reflection startles me, and I almost do a double take. With a pair of emerald eyes and royal blue hair just like Izumi's, there's no mistaking it—I'm in his sister's body.*

CH2_Emi: "Wow, the genes are strong in this family. . ."

*Instinctively, I raise my hands to touch my—her—face.*

CH2_Emi: "Her skin is so soft, I wonder what kind of skincare routine she has?"

CH2_Emi: "Ah, she's even got a beauty mark on her cheek!"

CH2_Emi: "She's drop-dead gorgeous. . ."

CH2_Emi: "As expected, an adult's body is really different."

*Instinctively, I look down at my chest.*

CH2_Emi: "She's definitely well-endowed. . ."

CH2_Emi: ". . ."

*An intrusive thought crosses my mind.*

CH2_Emi: "What if I just. . .?"

*Curiosity gets the better of me, and I start to raise my hands, intending to explore.*

Izumi: "Himari, are you done yet?"

CH2_Emi: "Eek!"

CH2_Emi: "I-I'll be right down! Just finishing up!"

*Izumi's voice from downstairs pulls me out of my thoughts, replacing my curiosity with a surge of embarrassment.*

CH2_Emi: "That was close. . ."

CH2_Emi: "No time for this. I need to hurry before Izumi leaves without me!"

CH2_Emi: "Okay, where's the closet. . ."

CH2_Emi: "AH!"

*Suddenly, my foot collides the edge of the bedframe. I fall to the floor, clutching my throbbing toe in agony.*

CH2_Emi: "Ouchh, that hurts!"

CH2_Emi: "Seriously? Is this karma? I didn't even do anything. . ."

CH2_Emi: ". . ."

CH2_Emi: "Let's just endure it and quickly get dressed."

CH2_Emi: "We made it! And we're here before lunch too!"

*As we step into the park, a brilliant display of red, orange, and gold leaves welcomes us, showcasing the beauty of the autumn season.*

*A canopy of trees arches overhead, blanketing the ground in brittle leaves that rustle softly underfoot.*

CH2_Emi: "(The temperature's perfect, not too hot nor too cold. Perfect for a photoshoot!)"

*I glance back at Izumi, who's calmly trailing behind me.*

Izumi: ". . ."

CH2_Emi: "What's with that look, Izumi?"

Izumi: ". . .Sis, you're unusually energetic today. Are you feeling alright?"

CH2_Emi: "E-eh? Ah, well, I just had a really good sleep! Yeah, that's it!"

CH2_Emi: "I'm bursting with energy, so it's hard to contain! Nothing out of the ordinary here, ahaha. . ."

Izumi: "Hmm, is that so. . ."

*Izumi's gaze lingers, but he lets it go, turning his attention to his camera instead.*

CH2_Emi: "(Sigh, how am I supposed to know how his sister usually acts?)"

CH2_Emi: "(I'm not cut out for this acting business. . .)"

CH2_Emi: "(Well, at least he didn't question it too much.)"

CH2_Emi: "Everything ready to go? Shall we start shooting?"

*Izumi gives a thumbs up, indicating that he's ready to go.*

*He heads off towards a bridge in the distance, beginning to snap photos without a word.*

CH2_Emi: "(Hmm, I should probably let him focus on his own thing. He looks pretty content as is.)"

CH2_Emi: "(Hopefully, this trip will help him find the perfect shot he's been searching for.)"

CH2_Emi: "(In the meantime, let's explore the park!)"

*I turn on my feet and decide to follow the trail, eager to discover what the park has to offer.*

*As I walk, the trail meanders through a dense thicket. The air is cool and fresh, leaving me rejuvenated with a rich, earthly scent.*

CH2_Emi: "(. . .Huh? Is that water?)"

*My ears pick up on the sound of rushing water from afar, growing louder with each step I take.*

CH2_Emi: "(Is there a lake or river down this path?)"

CH2_Emi: "(Sounds exciting. Let's keep walking and find out!)"

*After some time, I find myself at the edge of a small clearing, where a picturesque scene unfolds before me.*

CH2_Emi: "Whoa, this place looks amazing!"

*A breathtaking waterfall cascades down a rocky formation, dividing into many smaller rivulets as it descends.*

*Below, a clear stream ripples with gentle currents, creating small bubbles that rest along the rocky riverbank.*

*The scene leaves me speechless, completely captivated by its ephemeral beauty.*

CH2_Emi: "This location is surprisingly beautiful! I never expected to find such a gem here."

CH2_Emi: "This could be a great spot for a photoshoot with Izumi."

*As I linger by the stream, the rhythmic sound of water splashing against the rocks becomes a soothing melody.*

*I watch as people stroll by, their faces fill with awe and wonder. Some stop to whip out their phones and take photos, capturing the moment to cherish later.*

UK_generic: "Haruto! Don't run too fast, watch out for the rocks!"

*Just as I turn my head, I catch a young kid heading in my direction, bounding across the rocks as if they were pavement.*

*He stops atop a particularly large boulder, striking an adventurous pose. His eyes are fixed on the waterfall, glittering with innocuous joy.*

Haruto: "Wow, this is so cool!"

Haruto: "Grandpa, grandma, look at the waterfa—!"

*Just as the kid turns to call out to his grandparents, he slips and loses his footing, descending towards the stream's currents.*

CH2_Emi: "(Oh no! He's going to fall in!)"

*I quickly rush forward and grab the kid's arm, pulling him in just before he touches the water's surface.*

*Bringing him into a more stable area, I crouch down and hold his arms, checking for any injuries.*

CH2_Emi: "Are you alright? Is your foot okay?"

Haruto: "I-I'm okay. . ."

*The kid looks at me as his eyes grow teary, clearly shaken by the fall. Just then, his grandparents approach us with worried looks plastered on their faces.*

Grandpa: "Haruto! How many times have we told you not to run ahead of us?"

Grandpa: "Especially in such a rocky area, you almost fell in! You could've drowned!"

Haruto: "Grandpa. . . I'm s-sorry. . ."

*The kid starts bawling after getting scolded, tears streaming down his flushed cheeks.*

*His grandpa gets flustered and looks towards his wife for help, not meaning to make him cry.*

Grandma: "Your grandfather was just worried about you dear. You nearly gave us a heart attack after all."

Grandma: "Thank goodness this young lady was here to save you in time. What do we say to her?"

Haruto: "Sniff. . ."

Haruto: "Th-thank you for saving me miss. . ."

CH2_Emi: "It's no problem. Make sure to listen to your grandparents and walk carefully next time, alright?"

*I pat the kid's head, reassuring him that everything is alright now. The kid nods and wipes his tears, trying to pull himself together.*

*His grandparents both bow their heads to express their thanks, and the family heads off to enjoy the waterfall on their own.*

*After saying goodbye, I head back on the trail, deciding I should go back to Izumi and tell him about my new discovery.*

*Upon my return, I notice the sun peeking through the clouds, casting a bright glow over the park. The air has grown noticeably warmer since we arrived, adding to the pleasant atmosphere.*

*After some searching, I spot Izumi sitting on a bench, savoring a bento box brought from home.*

CH2_Emi: "Izumi, I'm back!"

Izumi: "Ah, sis, there you are. I was wondering where you went."

Izumi: "What were you up to while I was taking photos?"

CH2_Emi: "I was exploring! I wanted to see more of the park while you were busy."

CH2_Emi: "Guess what? I found a waterfall, and it was amazing! If you follow the stream along the trail, you'll discover it too."

Izumi: "A waterfall? That's exciting, I didn't expect to see one around here."

CH2_Emi: "Right? I was so surprised!"

Izumi: "Haha, it sounds like you enjoyed yourself."

CH2_Emi: "We should definitely check it out together! I feel like it'd be a great spot for photos."

Izumi: "Hmm, maybe. But let's eat lunch first and then decide."

*Izumi smiles as he hands me a container, neatly wrapped in a ornamental cloth.*

Izumi: "Here's your bento. I warmed it up at a nearby convenience store. You should eat before it gets cold."

CH2_Emi: "Ah, thank you!"

*I sit down next to Izumi, grabbing the bento box from him as he digs around his bag for some disposable chopsticks.*

*After getting through the knot on top, I open the box, revealing a mouthwatering lunch inside.*

*There's chicken karaage resting on a bed of green leaf lettuce, accompanied by rolls of tamagoyaki and a mix of cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. To top it all off, there's a piece of umeboshi cradled in some steaming rice.*

CH2_Emi: "(Wow, this looks so yummy!)"

*I happily dig in, savouring each and every bite.*

CH2_Emi: "(This is the life! Homemade food really is the best.)"

CH2_Emi: "By the way, Izumi, how did the photos turn out so far?"

Izumi: "They're okay, I guess. Here, you can have a look if you'd like."

*Izumi momentarily stops eating, wiping his hands with a handkerchief before handing me his camera in a careful manner.*

*As I browse through the gallery, my eyes are treated to beautiful compositions of nature. There are images featuring all sorts of subjects, from vibrant landscapes to detailed photos of birds amongst the trees.*

CH2_Emi: "These are incredible! Izumi, you-"

*I glance at Izumi to compliment him, but am taken aback as soon as I see the disappointed etched on his face.*

*Suddenly, I'm reminded of what he said about not being satisfied with his photos, a goal that has eluded him until now.*

CH2_Emi: "(I thought that giving him the freedom to shoot on his own would have yielded good results, but it seems like that's not the case.)"

CH2_Emi: "(The photos are stunning, but if they don't meet his standards, then this will all be for naught.)"

CH2_Emi: "(The question is, how can I help him achieve what he's aiming for. . .?)"

CH2_Emi: "(. . .I should get a second opinion on this. Maybe Ingram can offer some insights that will help us.)"

CH2_Emi: "Izumi, I'm gonna step away for a bit. I need to call someone."

Izumi: "Huh? Oh, okay then. Don't take too long, you haven't finished your lunch yet."

CH2_Emi: "Don't worry, I'll be back before you know it!"

CH2_Emi: "(Alright, looks like I'm out of sight. Don't think anybody's going to disturb me here.)"

CH2_Emi: "(Now then, I just need to focus. . .)"

*I close my eyes and begin clearing my mind. With each deep breath, my thoughts fade away one by one.*

*Once I feel calm enough, I switch to my inner voice and begin to speak.*

CH2_Emi: "(Ingram, are you there? I need your advice on something.)"

CH2_Emi: "(. . .)"

Ingram: "(. . .Hello? Can you hear me?)"

CH2_Emi: "(. . .!)"

CH2_Emi: "(Yes, loud and clear!)"

Ingram: "(Okay. that's good. What's up?)"

CH2_Emi: "(So Izumi and I are at this park and he's been shooting for a couple hours now.)"

CH2_Emi: "(But he doesn't seem to be getting any closer to getting the ideal photo he wanted originally.)"

Ingram: "(Hmm, do you know what he's been shooting so far?)"

CH2_Emi: "(Just various things related to nature, like birds and scenery.)"

Ingram: "(No people? That's interesting.)"

Ingram: "(When he first mentioned photography, I would've thought he did portraits of people or something.)"

CH2_Emi: "(Wait, you're right. I don't think I saw anybody in his gallery when I was going through it. Could it be that he doesn't have a model?)"

Ingram: "(I'm not sure what the reason might be.)"

Ingram: "(But I think it's worth getting him to try considering a different subject. Maybe a change of pace is what he needs.)"

CH2_Emi: "(Okay! I'll try convincing him to do that.)"

CH2_Emi: "(Thanks Ingram, I'm gonna talk to him right now.)"

Ingram: "(Anytime. Good luck.)"

*After my conversation with Ingram ends, I head back to Izumi, who is just about finished his bento.*

*A glimmer of hope sparks within me, wondering if Ingram's advice might be the key to helping Izumi.*

*Gathering my courage, I resolve to be direct and approach Izumi.*

CH2_Emi: "Izumi, I'm back. Sorry for taking a while."

Izumi: "Oh, welcome back sis. Are you still hungry? I'm about to pack everything up."

CH2_Emi: "I'm fine, you can go ahead."

Izumi: ". . .Is something the matter? What's with the look on your face?"

CH2_Emi: "Well, as I was making my way back, I realized something about your photos."

Izumi: "Huh? What is it?"

CH2_Emi: "When I was going through your gallery earlier, there were all sorts of different subjects. And they were all very lovely."

CH2_Emi: "But what stood out to me was that there wasn't any people. No portraits or headshots."

CH2_Emi: "So I was thinking, why don't we ask around and have you snap some photos of some random people for a change of pace?"

Izumi: ". . .!"

*Izumi fidgets with his camera strap, a nervous energy palpable in his movements. A crease forms between his brows, seemingly anxious about approaching a stranger out of the blue.*

CH2_Emi: "Oh, if you're nervous about asking someone to model for you, I can do the talking instead if you'd like!"

*He thinks to himself for a bit, taking my idea into consideration.*

*After a moment of contemplation, a flicker of determination lights up his eyes, and he finally nods.*

Izumi: ". . .Okay. Let's give it a try."

CH2_Emi: "Great! We should also change our location too. You spent most of your time here, so we should explore a different part of the park!"

CH2_Emi: "We can go to the waterfall I told you about earlier. It really is a nice place."

Izumi: "That's true, you did mention that."

Izumi: "Ah, but I was really looking forward to seeing the maple trees too. . ."

Izumi: ". . .But I trust your opinion sis. What do you think?"
