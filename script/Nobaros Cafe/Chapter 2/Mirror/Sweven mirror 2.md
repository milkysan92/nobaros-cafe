# Sweven Mirror 2

UK_generic: ". . .is."

UK_generic: ". . .Sis. Wake up."

UK_generic: "We're supposed to head out soon."

UK_generic: ". . .Himari!"

Emi: ". . .!"

Emi: "Izumi. . .?"

Izumi: "*Sigh*, finally, you're awake. I've been trying to wake you up for an hour now."

Emi: "Eh? What's going on?"

Izumi: "Sis. . .did you forget that we were supposed to go on a trip today?"

Emi: "(A trip. . .is he talking about one of those trips he goes on with his sister?)"

Emi: "(So then, am I posing as his sister at the moment?)"

Emi: "(Hmm, let's play along for now. . .)"

Emi: "A-ahh, that's right! Sorry, I think I'm still half asleep."

Emi: "Can you remind me where we're headed?"

Izumi: "We're supposed to head to Momiji Park. It's apparently quite scenic at this time of year."

Izumi: "Especially the maple trees at Momiji Shrine. I'm looking forward to seeing them myself."

Izumi: "Anyways, you should get ready. It takes around one to two hours to get there so we should head out as soon as we can."

*Izumi exits the room, closing the door with a solid thud behind him.* 

*I slowly sit up from bed, stretching my arms towards the ceiling while letting out a deep yawn. A hint of sweet lavender blesses my nose, rousing me from my dazed state.*

*In front of me, a wooden desk with a simple, minimalistic setup catches my eye. It features a large monitor, a few succulents, and a desk lamp designed like a calico cat. Soft morning rays filter through two big windows, casting an airy glow over the room.*

*Pushing the covers out of the way, I leap out of bed and walk over to the mirror to examine myself.*

Emi: ". . .Eh?! Is this what I look like?"

*The reflection startles me, and I almost do a double take. With a pair of emerald eyes and royal blue hair just like Izumi's, there's no mistaking it—I'm in his sister's body.*

Emi: "Wow, the genes are strong in this family. Izumi and his sister look so alike."

*Instinctively, I raise my hands to touch my—her—face.*

Emi: "Her skin is so fair, what kind of skincare routine does she have? And she has such a small face too!"

Emi: "Ah, she even has a mole near her right eye!"

Emi: "She's a total femme fatale. . ."

Emi: "I guess this is what it must feel like to be fully developed."

*Instinctively, I look down at my chest.*

Emi: "She's definitely well-endowed. . ."

Emi: ". . ."

*An intrusive thought crosses my mind.*

Emi: "What if I just. . .?"

*Curiosity gets the better of me, and I start to raise my hands, intending to explore.*

Izumi: "Himari, are you done yet?"

Emi: "Eek!"

Emi: "I-I'll be right down! Just finishing up!"

*Izumi's voice from downstairs pulls me out of my thoughts, replacing my curiosity with a surge of embarrassment.*

Emi: "That was close. . ."

Emi: "No time for this. I need to hurry before Izumi leaves without me!"

Emi: "Okay, where's the closet. . . OUCH!"

*Suddenly, my foot collides the edge of the bedframe. I fall to the floor, clutching my throbbing toe in agony.*

Emi: "Aw man, seriously? Is this karma? I didn't even do anything. . ."

Emi: "Let's just endure it and quickly get dressed."

Emi: "We made it! And we're here before lunch too!"

*As we enter the park, a kaleidoscope of red, orange and gold greets us, indicating that it's prime season for autumn foliage. A canopy of trees arches overhead, blanketing the ground in brittle leaves that rustle softly underfoot.*

*I glance back at Izumi, who's calmly trailing behind me.*

Izumi: ". . ."

Emi: "What's with that look, Izumi?"

Izumi: ". . .Sis, you're unusually energetic today. Are you feeling alright?"

Emi: "E-eh? Ah, well, I just had a really good sleep! Yeah, that's it!"

Izumi: "Hmm, is that so. . ."

*Izumi's gaze lingers, but he lets it go, turning his attention to his camera to check the lens attachment.*

Emi: "Everything ready to go? Shall we start shooting?"

*Izumi gives a thumbs up and heads off towards a bridge in the distance, beginning to snap photos without a word.*

Emi: "(Hmm, I should probably let him focus on his own thing. He looks pretty content as is.)"

Emi: "(Hopefully, this trip will help him find the perfect shot he's been searching for.)"

Emi: "(In the meantime, let's explore the park!)"

*I turn on my feet and decide to follow the park trail, eager to discover what the park has to offer.*

*As I walk, the trail meanders through a dense thicket, surrounding me in a fiery display of autumn colours. The air is cool and fresh, leaving me rejuvenated with a rich, earthly scent. The sound of rushing water can be hear from afar, growing louder with each step I take.*

*After some time, I find myself at the edge of a small clearing, where a picturesque scene unfolds before me.*

Emi: "Whoa, this place looks amazing!"

*A breathtaking waterfall cascades down a rocky formation, dividing into many smaller streams as it descends. Below, a clear stream ripples, creating small bubbles that rest along its banks. The scene leaves me speechless, completely captivated by its ephemeral beauty.*

Emi: "This location is surprisingly beautiful! I never expected to find such a gem here."

Emi: "This could be a great spot for a photoshoot with Izumi."

*As I linger by the stream, the rhythmic sound of water splashing against the rocks becomes a soothing melody.*

*I watch as people stroll by, their faces fill with awe and wonder. Some stop to whip out their phones and take photos, capturing the moment to cherish later.

*Eventually, I reluctantly tear myself away, deciding that I should go back to Izumi and tell him about my new discovery.*

*Upon my return, I notice the sun peeking through the clouds, casting a bright glow over the park. The air has grown noticeably warmer since we arrived, adding to the pleasant atmosphere.*

*After some searching, I spot Izumi sitting on a bench, savoring a bento box brought from home.*

Emi: "Izumi, I'm back!"

Izumi: "Ah, sis, there you are. I was wondering where you went."

Izumi: "What were you up to while I was taking photos?"

Emi: "I was exploring! I wanted to see more of the park while you were busy."

Emi: "Guess what? I found a waterfall, and it was amazing! If you follow the stream along the trail, you'll discover it too."

Izumi: "A waterfall? That's exciting, I didn't expect to see one around here."

Emi: "Right? I was so surprised!"

Izumi: "Haha, it sounds like you enjoyed yourself."

Emi: "We should definitely check it out together! I feel like it'd be a great spot for photos."

Izumi: "Hmm, maybe. But let's eat lunch first and then decide."

*Izumi smiles as he hands me a container, neatly wrapped in a ornamental cloth.*

Izumi: "Here's your bento. I warmed it up at a nearby convenience store. You should eat before it gets cold."

Emi: "Ah, thank you!"

*I sit down next to Izumi, grabbing the bento box from him as he digs around his bag for some disposable chopsticks. After getting through the knot on top, I open the box, revealing a mouthwatering lunch inside.*

*There's chicken karaage resting on a bed of green leaf lettuce, accompanied by rolls of tamagoyaki and a mix of cucumbers and cherry tomatoes. To top it all off, there's a piece of umeboshi cradled in some steaming rice.*

Emi: "(Wow, this looks so yummy!)"

*I happily dig in, savouring each and every bite.*

Emi: "(This is the life! Homemade food really is the best.)"

Emi: "By the way, Izumi, how did the photos turn out so far?"

Izumi: They're okay, I guess. Here, you can have a look if you'd like."

*Izumi momentarily stops eating, wiping his hands in a meticulous manner before handing me his camera in a cautious manner.*

*As I browse through the gallery, my eyes are treated to beautiful compositions of nature. The gallery contains images featuring all sorts of subjects, from the vibrant trees to detailed photos of birds amongst the trees.*

Emi: "These are incredible! Izumi, you-"

*I glance at Izumi to compliment him, but am taken aback as soon as I see the disappointed etched on his face.*

*Suddenly, I'm reminded of his desire to create his magnum opus, a goal that has eluded him until now.*

Emi: "(Hmm, I thought that giving him the freedom to shoot on his own would have yielded some good results. But it seems like that's not the case.)"

Emi: "(While I think the photos are stunning, if they don't meet his standards, then it's not enough!)"

Emi: "(The question is, how can I help him achieve what he's aiming for. . .?)"

Emi: "(. . .I should get a second opinion on this. Maybe Ingram can offer some insights that will help us.)"

Emi: "(Ingram, are you there? I need your advice on something.)"

Emi: "(. . .)"

Ingram: "(Hello? Can you hear me?)"

Emi: "(. . .!)"

Emi: "(Yes, loud and clear!)"

Ingram: "(Okay. that's good. What's up?)"

Emi: "(So Izumi and I are at this park and he's been shooting for a couple hours now.)"

Emi: "(But he doesn't seem to be getting any closer to getting the ideal photo he wanted originally.)"

Ingram: "(Hmm, do you know what he's been shooting so far?)"

Emi: "(Just various things related to nature, like birds and scenery.)"

Ingram: "(No people? That's interesting.)"

Ingram: "(When he first mentioned photography, I would've thought he did portraits of people or something.)"

Emi: "(Wait ,you're right, I don't think I saw anybody in his gallery when I was going through it. Could it be that he doesn't have a model?)"

Ingram: "(I'm not sure what the reason might be.)"

Ingram: "(But I think it's worth getting him to try considering a different subject. Maybe a change of pace is what he needs.)"

Emi: "(Okay! I'll try convincing him to do that.)"

Emi: "(Thanks Ingram, I'm gonna talk to him right now.)"

Ingram: "(Anytime. Good luck.)"

*After my conversation with Ingram ends, I turn my attention to Izumi, who is finishing up his bento. A glimmer of hope sparks within me, wondering if Ingram's advice might be the key to helping Izumi.*

*Gathering my courage, I resolve to be direct and approach Izumi.*

Emi: "Izumi, I noticed something when I was going through your gallery."

Izumi: "Huh? What is it?"

Emi: "There's all sorts of different subjects in your photos, and they're very beautiful. But what stood out to me was that there wasn't any people. No portraits or headshots."

Izumi: ". . .!"

Emi: "So I was thinking, why don't we ask around and have you snap some photos of some random people for a change of pace?"

*Izumi fidgets with his camera strap, a nervous energy palpable in his movements as he takes my suggestion into consideration. A crease forms between his brows, seeming anxious about approaching a stranger to model for him.*

*Despite his nervousness, a flicker of determination lights up his eyes as he finally nods.*

Izumi: ". . .Okay. Let's give it a try."

Emi: "Great! We should also change our location too. You spent most of your time here, so we should explore a different part of the park!"

Emi: "We can go to the waterfall I told you about earlier. It really is a nice place."

Izumi: "That's true, you did mention that."

Izumi: "Ah, but I was really looking forward to seeing the maple trees too. . ."

Izumi: ". . .But I trust your opinion sis. What do you think?"
