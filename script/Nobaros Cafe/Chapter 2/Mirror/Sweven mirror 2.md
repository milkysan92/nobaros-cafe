UK_generic: ". . .is."

UK_generic: ". . .Sis. Wake up."

Uk_generic: "We're supposed to head out soon."

Emi: ". . .!"

Emi: "Izumi. . .?"

Izumi: "*Sigh*, finally, you're awake. I've been trying to wake you up for an hour now."

Emi: "Eh? What's going on?"

Izumi: "Sis. . .did you forget that we were supposed to go on a trip today?"

Emi: "(A trip. . .like one of those trips he goes on with his sister?)"

Emi: "(Does that mean I'm in his sister's body? Let's play along for now. . .)"

Emi: "A-ahh, that's right! Sorry, I think I'm still half asleep."

Emi: "Can you remind me where we're headed?"

Izumi: "We're supposed to head to Momiji Park. From what you told me, it's apparently quite scenic at this time of year because all the leaves are starting to change colour."

Izumi: "I'm pretty excited about seeing the maple trees myself."

Izumi: "Anyways, you should get ready. It'll take an hour to two to get there so we should head out as soon as we can."

*I watch as Izumi exits the room, closing the door behind him with a solid thud. Immediately, I get out of bed and stare at myself in the mirror.*

*A pair of emerald eyes stare back at me, velvety soft strands of royal blue framing my face*
