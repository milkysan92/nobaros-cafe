# Waterfall
CH2_Emi: "I think we should head to the waterfall after all. It'll show up well on camera, so I don't think you could ever go wrong there."

*Izumi nods, complying with my decision.*

Izumi: "Okay, if that's what you think. I'll follow you."

*He quickly packs up our lunches, and soon we're on our feet, eager to try something new for the photoshoot.*

CH2_Emi: ". . .Hey Izumi, can I ask you something?"

Izumi: "Hmm? What's up?"

CH2_Emi: "What usually goes through your mind when you're taking a photo? Is there a particular image or feeling you aim for?"

Izumi: "What goes through my mind. . .?"

Izumi: "Well, to be honest, I try not to overthink when I'm looking through the lens."

Izumi: "But I do go in with the mindset of wanting to capture the beauty of the subject in front of me."

CH2_Emi: "Oh, so you try to take the most beautiful shot possible then?"

Izumi: "In a sense, yeah. But the subject itself doesn't have to be super unique or anything."

Izumi: "It's more about appreciating the world around us. If you saw a tree branch, you wouldn't think much of it, right?"

Izumi: "But that branch is the result of a tiny seed going through many ordeals to grow into a big tree. If you take that into consideration, then wouldn't it become more meaningful?"

CH2_Emi: "When you put it that way, that's true. It's one of the small things we take for granted because it's all around us, right?"

Izumi: "Exactly. When I take a photo, I want people to feel something when they look at it. I want them to see the story and the beauty behind even the simplest subjects."

CH2_Emi: "I see, you really put a lot of thought behind these pictures, huh?"

Izumi: "Yeah, that's right. Even though they're still images, they feel alive in a way. Whenever I attend exhibitions, that's the feeling I get from the work of other photographers."

Izumi: "The hard part is just figuring out how to capture that feeling myself."

Emi: "So if you manage to achieve that, would you be satisfied with your photos then?"

Izumi: "I would think so. I'd love to see that sense of life and emotion in my own work."

CH2_Emi: "(Hmm, it might've been for the better that I chose the waterfall over the maple trees then.)"

CH2_Emi: "(I hope we manage to take some photos that are up to his standards later on.)"

*After treading down the path for a while, I eventually manage to pick up the faint sounds of crashing water again.*

CH2_Emi: "I hear the waterfall! We're almost there, it's just right up ahead!"

*I grow excited and prepare myself to run down the path, only to be stopped by Izumi's firm grip on my wrist.*

Izumi: "Sis, don't go running off. You know I can't take strenuous exercise. My heart won't be able to keep up."

CH2_Emi: "Oh, that's right. Sorry, I got too excited for a second there."

CH2_Emi: "Let's just walk at our own pace then."

CH2_Emi: "Here it is! What do you think?"

*Izumi walks past me, his mouth agape as he takes in the breathtaking sight before him.*

Izumi: ". . .You were right, Sis. This place is quite nice. Watching the waterfall feels therapeutic."

Izumi: "And it would make a good subject for photos."

CH2_Emi: "(That's a good sign! If he feels inspired, maybe it'll influence the photoshoot.)"

Izumi: "Ah, but you mentioned taking pictures of people for a change right? Who should we ask?"

*I scan the area, searching for someone who might be open to modelling.*

CH2_Emi: "(Hmm, technically, we could ask any one of these people here. But they all seem preoccupied in taking their own photos.)"

Izumi: "Um, maybe I should just take more nature shots instead. I mean, people might not want to be bothered. . ."

CH2_Emi: "(. . .He seems just as nervous as earlier. Maybe he's more anxious about this than I realized.)"

CH2_Emi: "That's okay, we don't have to ask someone else if they're busy. How about I model for you instead?"

CH2_Emi: "It'll be more comfortable, and you can direct me as much as you need!"

*Izumi sighs in relief at my suggestion.*

Izumi: "I'm down for that idea. Let me get my camera ready then."

*Izumi uncaps his camera and double-checks everything, moving excitedly.*

CH2_Emi: "(Seems like I was right about his social anxiety. Is that why he hasn't taken pictures of anyone until now?)"

Izumi: "Okay, I'm good to go. Could you stand closer to the rocks over there and strike a pose?"

CH2_Emi: "Got it! What kind of pose should I do? Do you want me to change it up every once in a while?"

Izumi: "Hmm, you can do whatever feels natural to you. I don't think you need to think too hard about it."

Izumi: "If you really can't think of anything, just look at me and smile."

Izumi: "I'll figure something out."

*I nod at Izumi's advice, and cautiously make my way over to the riverbank. Taking a moment to position myself amongst the rocks, I strike a pose, flashing a bright smile.*

*It takes him a moment to find the right angles but eventually, he gets into the zone and shoots away.*

*With the sun slowly descending, he tries different poses and locations around the waterfall, trying to capture the perfect moment.*

Izumi: ". . .!"

Izumi: "Himari, freeze! Stay right in that position, this is a good shot."

*Just as the sun casts its golden glow over me, Izumi's shutter goes off, capturing another series of photos.*

Izumi: "Okay, I'm all done. You can relax now."

CH2_Emi: "(Ah, finally finished! That was a long photoshoot, I hope I posed well enough.)"

*I walk over to Izumi, who is intently reviewing the photos on his camera.*

CH2_Emi: "How did the photos turn out? Did we capture what you were looking for?"

*I place a hand on Izumi's shoulder and peer into the camera screen with him.*

*There's an ethereal headshot of me, my expression trance-like as I gaze into the distance. The spray from the waterfall forms a rainbow, enhancing the whole composition with a delicate, shimmering backdrop.*

CH2_Emi: "(Wow, that's a nice headshot! Is this really me?)"

CH2_Emi: "(But what does Izumi think?)"

*I turn to Izumi to ask for his opinion, but his disappointed expression stops me.*

Izumi: "They're good photos, but. . ."

CH2_Emi: ". . .Nothing felt different this time?"

Izumi: "No, unfortunately not."

Izumi: "Looking at these photos, it's. . . just the same as before."

Izumi: ". . .Perhaps it just comes down to experience, and that my skills just aren't there yet."

CH2_Emi: "What? But you're an amazing photographer! You've been shooting for so long, and your pictures get a lot of attention on the blog!"

Izumi: "Well, that doesn't mean that I've learned it all. There's always room for improvement."

Izumi: "Maybe I'm being too perfectionistic, but what does it matter if I can't take photos that aren't up to my standards?"

Izumi: "At the end of the day, I wasn't able to capture the feeling that I wanted. That means I need to grow and improve on myself as a photographer. . ."

*Izumi's frustration is evident as he packs his camera away with furrowed brows. I watch him silently, trying to figure out how to comfort him.*

CH2_Emi: "(I was so sure this would work. I must've had the wrong idea. . .)"

CH2_Emi: ". . .I'm sorry, I should've listened to you about seeing the maple trees instead. Maybe you could've found your answer there."

Izumi: "It's okay, Sis. You were doing your best to help, it's not your fault."

Izumi: "If anything, at least I got to try something new through this experience."

Izumi: "It made me realize I still have a lot to work on myself."

Izumi: "Thanks for bringing me here, it was fun."

Izumi: ". . .Let's head home. It's getting late."

*Izumi smiles faintly before turning back in the direction we came from. As I trail behind him, I watch his back, unable to shake off the guilt.*

CH2_Emi: "(He says that, but he doesn't have any more time. . .)"

CH2_Emi: "(I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you. . .)"

CH2_Emi: ". . ."

*. . .*

Ingram: "Welcome back. It's over now."

Emi: "Hmm. . .?"

*I slowly open my eyes, seeing Ingram standing right in front of me.*

Emi: "I'm back. . ."

Ingram: "How did everything go?"

*I turn my gaze away, the guilt weighing down on me like a heavy stone pressing on my chest. His question is innocent, yet it feels like an added burden, a reminder of my inability to help Izumi.*

Emi: "(I was so motivated to help Izumi, but in the end, he couldn't find his answer. . .)"

*I feel Ingram's stare burning into me, yet I struggle to find the words to respond to him. Before I'm able to piece together an answer to his question, he places a hand on my head.*

Emi: ". . . !"

Ingram: "You don't need to tell me. I can see it in your face."

Ingram: "This isn't an easy role. Despite all your efforts, not everybody gets their happy ending."

Ingram: "Our job is to provide second chances, but we can't guarantee success."

Ingram: "Don't beat yourself up over it."

Emi: "Ingram. . ."

Emi: "I just. . ."

*I can't help but feel glum at the bittersweet comfort in Ingram's words.*

Emi: "It's unfortunate that he left without a proper conclusion to his life's work."

Ingram: ". . .In the end, Izumi may not have been able to achieve his goal as a photographer."

Ingram: "But it wasn't in vain. You were able to give him one last trip with his sister."

Ingram: "As a brother, don't you think he would've been happy going on another adventure and spending time with her?"

Ingram: "Surely, that must've meant something to him."

*Ingram's words lift my spirits, offering a glimmer of comfort.*

*It's reassuring to think that maybe, just maybe, I did bring some happiness to Izumi. Yet a part of me hesitates to fully accept it, knowing deep down that his unfulfilled desire still lingers.*

*As I mull over Ingram's perspective, his advice begins to sink in, my interactions with Izumi flashing through my mind.*

*Recalling the smile on Izumi's face during the photoshoot, I realize that Ingram's words ring true. This journey wasn't entirely in vain.*

Emi: ". . .Perhaps you're right. Thanks Ingram."

Emi: "You know, this experience makes me curious about what's in store for me later, when I recover my own memories."

Ingram: "Who knows? But as you continue spirit guiding, you'll be going through other people's memories a lot."

Ingram: "With that much exposure, there's a good chance that it'll help jog your own memories to return."

Ingram: "It's getting late now. We should head back home and join the others for dinner. I'm sure they're getting hungry."

Emi: "That's a good idea, I'm also starved."

Ingram: "Let's get going then."
