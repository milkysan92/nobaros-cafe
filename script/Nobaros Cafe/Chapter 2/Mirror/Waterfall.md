# Waterfall
CH2_Emi: "I think we should head to the waterfall. I really want to show it to you."

*Izumi nods, complying with my decision.*

Izumi: "Okay, if that's what you think. I'll follow you."

*He quickly packs up our lunches, and soon we're on our feet, eager to try something new for the photoshoot.*

CH2_Emi: "(I hope this works! I really want him to figure out what he's missing.)"

*After treading down the path for a while, I eventually manage to pick up the faint sounds of crashing water again.*

CH2_Emi: "I hear the waterfall! We're almost there, it's just right up ahead!"

*I grow excited and prepare myself to run down the path, only to be stopped by Izumi's firm grip on my wrist.*

Izumi: "Sis, don't go running off. You know I can't take strenuous exercise. My heart won't be able to keep up."

CH2_Emi: "Oh, that's right. Sorry, I got too excited for a second there."

CH2_Emi: "Let's just walk at our own pace then."

CH2_Emi: "Here it is! What do you think?"

*Izumi walks past me, his mouth agape as he takes in the breathtaking sight before him.*

Izumi: ". . .You were right, sis. This place is quite nice. Watching the waterfall feels therapeutic."

Izumi: "And it would make a good subject for photos."

CH2_Emi: "(That's a good sign! If he feels inspired, maybe it'll influence the photoshoot.)"

Izumi: "Ah, but you mentioned taking pictures of people for a change right? Who should we ask?"

*I scan the area, searching for someone who might be open to modelling.*

CH2_Emi: "(Hmm, technically, we could ask any one of these people here. But they all seem preoccupied in taking their own photos.)"

Izumi: "Um, maybe I should just take more nature shots instead. I mean, people might not want to be bothered. . ."

CH2_Emi: "(. . .He seems just as nervous as earlier. Maybe he's more anxious about this than I realized.)"

CH2_Emi: "That's okay, we don't have to ask someone else if they're busy. How about I model for you instead?"

CH2_Emi: "It'll be more comfortable, and you can direct me as much as you need!"

*Izumi sighs in relief at my suggestion.*

Izumi: "I'm down for that idea. Let me get my camera ready then."

*Izumi uncaps his camera and double-checks everything, moving excitedly.*

CH2_Emi: "(Seems like I was right about his social anxiety. Is that why he hasn't taken pictures of anyone until now?)"

Izumi: "Okay, I'm good to go. Could you stand closer to the rocks over there and strike a pose?"

CH2_Emi: "Got it! What kind of pose should I do? Do you want me to change it up every once in a while?"

Izumi: "Hmm, you can do whatever feels natural to you. I don't think you need to think too hard about it."

Izumi: "If you really can't think of anything, just look at me and smile."

Izumi: "I'll figure something out."

*I nod at Izumi's advice, and cautiously make my way over to the riverbank. Taking a moment to position myself amongst the rocks, I strike a pose, flashing a bright smile.*

*It takes Izumi a moment to find the right angles but eventually, he gets into the zone and shoots away.*

*With the sun slowly descending, he tries different poses and locations around the waterfall, trying to capture the perfect moment.*

Izumi: ". . .!"

Izumi: "Himari, freeze! Stay right in that position, this is a good shot."

*Just as the sun casts its golden glow over me, Izumi's shutter goes off, capturing another series of photos.*

Izumi: "Okay, I'm all done. You can relax now."

CH2_Emi: "(Ah, finally finished! That was a long photoshoot, I hope I posed well enough.)"

*I walk over to Izumi, who is intently reviewing the photos on his camera.*

CH2_Emi: "How did the photos turn out? Did we capture what you were looking for?"

*I place a hand on Izumi's shoulder and peer into the camera screen with him.*

*There's an ethereal headshot of me, my expression trance-like as I gaze into the distance. The spray from the waterfall forms a rainbow, enhancing the whole composition with a delicate, shimmering backdrop.*

CH2_Emi: "(Wow, what an enchanting headshot! Is this really me?)"

*I turn to Izumi to ask for his opinion, but his disappointed expression stops me.*

Izumi: "They're good photos, but. . ."

CH2_Emi: ". . .Nothing felt different this time?"

Izumi: "No, unfortunately not."

Izumi: "Looking at these photos, it's like. . .they're empty. I don't know how to describe it."

Izumi: ". . .Perhaps my skills just aren't there yet. Maybe I'm trying to capture something beyond my reach."

CH2_Emi: "But you're an amazing photographer! You've been shooting for so long, and your pictures get a lot of attention on the blog!"

Izumi: "Well, that doesn't mean that I've learned it all. There's always room for improvement."

Izumi: "I guess I'm being too perfectionistic. I'll need to grow more as a photographer first. . ."

*Izumi's frustration is evident as he packs his camera. I watch him silently, trying to figure out how to comfort him.*

CH2_Emi: "(I was so sure this would work. I must've had the wrong idea. . .)"

CH2_Emi: ". . .I'm sorry, I should've listened to you about seeing the maple trees instead. Maybe you could've found your answer there."

Izumi: "It's okay, sis. You were doing your best to help."

Izumi: "If anything, at least I got to try something new through this experience."

Izumi: "It made me realize I still have a lot to learn before I can really be satisfied with myself."

Izumi: "Thanks for bringing me here, it was fun."

Izumi: ". . .Let's head home. It's getting late."

*Izumi smiles faintly before turning back in the direction we came from. As I trail behind him, I watch his back, unable to shake off the guilt.*

CH2_Emi: "(He says that, but he doesn't have any more time. . .)"

CH2_Emi: "(I'm sorry I wasn't able to help you. . .)"

CH2_Emi: ". . ."

*. . .*

Ingram: "Welcome back. It's over now."

CH2_Emi: "Hmm. . .?"

*I slowly open my eyes, seeing Ingram standing right in front of me.*

CH2_Emi: "I'm back. . ."

Ingram: "How did everything go?"


*I turn my gaze away, the guilt weighing down on me like a heavy stone pressing on my chest. His question is innocent, yet it feels like an added burden, a reminder of my inability to help Izumi.*

CH2_Emi: "(I was so motivated to help Izumi, but in the end, he couldn't find his answer. . .)"

*I feel Ingram's stare burning into me, yet I struggle to find the words to respond to him. Before I'm able to piece together an answer to his question, he places a hand on my head.*

CH2_Emi: ". . . !"

Ingram: "You don't need to tell me. I can see it in your face."

Ingram: "It's okay, this isn't an easy role. Despite all your efforts, not everybody gets their happy ending."

Ingram: "Our job is to provide second chances, but we can't guarantee success."

Ingram: "Don't beat yourself up over it."

*I can't help but feel glum at Ingram's words, which bring a bittersweet comfort.*

CH2_Emi: "I just. . ."

CH2_Emi: "It's unfortunate that he left without a proper conclusion to his life's work."

Ingram: ". . .In the end, Izumi may not have been able to achieve his goal as a photographer."

Ingram: "But it wasn't in vain. You were able to give him one last trip with his sister."

Ingram: "As a brother, don't you think he would've been happy going on another adventure and spending time with her?"

Ingram: "Surely, that must've meant something to him."

*Ingram's words lift my spirits, offering a glimmer of comfort. It's reassuring to think that maybe, just maybe, I did bring some happiness to Izumi.*

*Yet a part of me hesitates to fully accept it, knowing deep down that Izumi's unfulfilled desire still lingers.*

*As I mull over Ingram's perspective and reflect on my actions inside the mirror, his advice begins to sink in. Perhaps he's right, and the day wasn't entirely in vain.*

CH2_Emi: ". . .I guess you have a point. Thanks Ingram."

CH2_Emi: "You know, this experience makes me curious about what's in store for me later, when I recover my own memories."

Ingram: "Who knows? As you continue these spirit guiding missions, there'll be a good chance that it'll help jog your memories."

Ingram: "It's getting late now. We should head back home and join the others for dinner. I'm sure they're getting hungry."

CH2_Emi: "That's a good idea, I'm also starved."

Ingram: "Let's get going then."
