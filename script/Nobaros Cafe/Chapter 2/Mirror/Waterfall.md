# Waterfall
Emi: "I think we should head to the waterfall. I really want to show it to you."

*Izumi nods, complying with my decision.*

Izumi: "Okay, if that's what you think. I'll follow you."

*He quickly packs up our lunches, and soon we're on our feet, heading down the trail, eager to try something new for the photoshoot.*

Emi: "(I hope this works! I really want him to figure out what his 'missing something' is.)"

*After a while, I manage to pick up the faint sounds of crashing water in the distance.*

Emi: "The sound of water! We're almost there, Izumi!"

*I run ahead, leading Izumi to the waterfall. Unlike earlier, there are fewer people around, reducing the chance of photobombs.*

Emi: "Here it is! What do you think?"

*Izumi walks past me, his mouth agape. He looks around in awe, taking in the breathtaking sight before him.*

Izumi: ". . .You were right sis, this place is beautiful. I feel so peaceful, maybe even alive."

Izumi: "It inspires me to take more photos."

Emi: "(That's a good sign! If he feels inspired, maybe it'll influence the photoshoot.)"

Izumi: "Ah, but you mentioned taking pictures of people for a change. Who should we ask?"

*Izumi looks at me with a hesitant look, anxiety evident in his eyes. I scour the area, trying to look for someone who seems like they'd be willing to model.*

Emi: "(Hmm, I guess we could technically ask any one of these people here. But they're all engrossed in taking pictures on their phones.)"

Emi: "(Izumi seems nervous. Is he anxious about asking a random stranger to model for him?)"

Emi: "(If that's the case, then maybe I should try and make him feel comfortable and in his element.)"

Emi: "I can model for you. Since you haven't taken anybody's portrait before, why not start with me? It'll be more comfortable, and you can have me change poses all you want!"

*As if on cue, Izumi sighs in relief at my suggestion.*

Izumi: "I'm down for that idea. Let me go get my camera ready then."

*Izumi uncaps his camera and double checks everything, moving excitedly in an animated motion.*

Emi: "(Seems like I was right on the money. Is that why he hasn't taken pictures of anybody until now?)"

Izumi: "Okay, I'm good to go. Could I get you to stand closer to the rocks over there and strike a pose?"

Emi: "Got it! What kind of pose should I do?"

Izumi: "Hmm, I don't think you need to think too hard about it."

Izumi: "Just look at me and smile."

*I nod at Izumi's advice, and cautiously make my way over to the river bank. Taking a moment to position myself amongst the rocky shoreline, I strike a pose, flashing a bright smile.*

*It takes Izumi a moment to find the right angles but eventually, he gets into the zone and shoots away. As the sun slowly descending from its peak, he tries different poses and locations around the waterfall, trying to capture the perfect moment.*

Izumi: ". . .!"

**Izumi:** "Himari, freeze! Stay right in that position, this is a good shot."

*Just as the sun casts its golden glow over me, Izumi's shutter goes off, capturing another series of photos.*

Izumi: "Okay, I'm all done. You can relax now."

Emi: "(Ahh, finally finished! That was a long photoshoot, I hope I posed well enough.)"

*I walk over to Izumi, who is intently reviewing the photos on his camera.*

**Emi:** "How did the photos turn out? Did we capture what you were looking for?"

*I place a hand on Izumi's shoulder and peer into the camera screen with him. There's an ethereal headshot of me, my expression trance-like as I gaze into the distance. The spray from the waterfall creates a rainbow, enhancing the whole composition with a delicate, shimmering backdrop.*

Emi: "(Wow, what an enchanting headshot! Did he really take these just now?)"

*I turn to Izumi to ask for his opinion, but his disappointed expression stops me. It tells me all I need to know.*

**Izumi:** "They're good photos, but. . ."

Emi: ". . .Nothing felt different this time?"

Izumi: "No, unfortunately not."

Izumi: "Looking at these photos, it's like. . .they're empty. I don't know how to describe it."

Izumi: "It's like I'm looking for something that I can't quite capture with my camera."

Izumi: "Maybe I need more experience. My skills aren't enough to achieve what I want to see yet."

Emi: "But your pictures are great, and they get a lot of attention on the blog!"

Izumi: "But they don't satisfy me. I need to grow more as a photographer. . ."

*Izumi's frustration is evident as he packs his camera.*

*I watch him silently, trying to figure out how to comfort him. The purpose of this entire trip was for him to capture the perfect photo, and now the day is almost over without any successful shots. I feel helpless.*

Emi: "(I was so sure this would work. Maybe I had the wrong idea. . .)"

Emi: "(Izumi wanted to go see the maple trees, but I was too focused on the beauty of this location. Would it have been better to follow his wishes instead?)"

Emi: ". . .I'm sorry, I should've listened to you about wanting to go see the maple trees instead. Maybe you could've found your answer there."

**Izumi:** "It's okay, sis. You were doing your best to help."

Izumi: "If anything, at least I got to try something new through this experience. Thanks for bringing me here."

Izumi: ". . .Let's head home. It's getting late."

*Izumi smiles faintly before turning back in the direction we came from. As I trail behind him, I watch his back, unable to shake off the guilt in my heart.*

Emi: ". . ."

Ingram: "Welcome back. It's over now."

Emi: "Hmm. . .?"

*I slowly open my eyes, seeing Ingram standing right in front of me.*

Emi: "I'm back. . ."

Ingram: "How did everything go?"

*I turn my gaze away from Ingram, the guilt weighing down on me.*

Emi: "(I was so motivated to help Izumi, but in the end, he wasn't able to find his answer. . .)"

*Ingram silently observes me. I struggle to find the words, but before I'm able to piece together an answer to his question, he places a hand on my head.*

Emi: ". . . !"

Ingram: "You don't need to tell me. I can see it in your face."

Ingram: "It's not easy being in this role. Despite all your efforts, not everybody gets their happy ending."

Ingram: "Our job is to provide second chances, but we can't guarantee success."

*I can't help but feel a little more glum at Ingram's words, which bring a bittersweet comfort.*

Emi: "I just. . ."

Emi:  "It's unfortunate that he left without a proper conclusion to his life's work."

Ingram: "In the end, Izumi may not have been able to achieve his goal as a photographer ."

Ingram: "But it wasn't in vain. You were able to give him one last trip with his sister."

Ingram: "As a brother, don't you think he would've been happy going on another adventure and spending time with her?"

Ingram: "Surely, that must've meant something to him."

*Ingram's words lift my spirits, bringing me some comfort. It helps to know that, in some small way, I was able to add to Izumi's happiness.*

Emi: ". . .You're right. Thanks Ingram."

Emi: "You know, this experience makes me curious about what's in store for me later, when I recover my own memories."

Ingram: "Who knows? As you continue these spirit guiding missions, there'll be a good chance that it'll help jog your memories."

Ingram: "It's getting late now. We should head back home and join the others for dinner. I'm sure they're getting hungry."

Emi: "That's a good idea, I'm also starved."

Emi: "Let's head out then!"
