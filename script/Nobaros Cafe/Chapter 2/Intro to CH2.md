Emi: "Thank you for coming!"

Emi: "(Phew, that's the last customer! I can finally catch my breath. . .)"

*A bell chimes at the front of the store, signaling the end of the chaotic lunch hour.*

*The cafe had been busier than usual. The morning hours were peaceful, with a few regulars popping in for their usual coffee or bagel. As the sun rose higher in the sky, more and more customers trickled in, looking for a refreshment to enjoy.*

*Before I knew it, the store had filled up in the blink of an eye. I was scrambling in every direction, taking orders and relaying them to Ingram. Somehow, I managed to survive. Barely.*

*Suddenly, a small poke tapped at my shoulder, prompting me to look back. Ingram came from behind the counter, with two icy drinks in hand and a pleased smile on his face.*

Ingram: "Good job with the lunch rush. You held up pretty well out there."

Ingram: "Here, I made some iced coffee for us. Think of it as a little treat for working so hard. Drink up and rehydrate yourself."

*Ingram handed one of the drinks to me. I carefully brought the glass to my face, taking modest sips to avoid spilling coffee on myself. However, as soon as I was hit by the sweet taste, I was overcome by an overwhelming urge to devour the whole thing. I grew thirstier by the second, and small sips quickly turned into bigger gulps.*

 *Enjoying an icy cold treat on a hot day like today felt so satisfying. I hadn't drank much since morning, and the cooling sensation felt gratifying for the work I did earlier. Before I knew it, there were only a few ice cubes remaining at the bottom of my glass. I let out a satisfied sigh. I had finished everything, down to the last drop.*

Emi: "Thanks for the drink, I really needed that!"

*I looked at Ingram. The ice cubes in his drink made a distinct clink as he downed the rest of it. He seemed calm and collected, far from what I'd imagine from someone who also went through the same chaos I experienced earlier.*

Emi: "You know Ingram, you're really impressive for dealing with the barista duties. You handled yourself so well behind the counter. I never even knew a cafe could get that busy!"

Ingram: "Haha yeah, it's around this time that things start to really pick up the pace. It gets pretty intense sometimes. But one way or another, I've gotten used to it. It's nothing much really."

Ingram: "In time, you'll be able to breeze right through the rush hours too."

*I gulped. The idea of being able to deal with so many orders at once seemed like a faraway dream.*

Emi: "(Maybe in a million years sure....)"

Ingram: "Well then! It looks like we've passed through the worst of it. Now we can focus on other stuff to do."

*I nearly choked.*

Emi: "Huh?! S-say that again? There's still more?"

Ingram: "Of course. We're only halfway through the day."

Emi: "(. . . is it just me? Why does he look so happy about this?)"

*Ingram looked straight at me, his smug smile not budging a single bit. He was dead serious. Maybe even a bit sadistic.*

Emi: "...*Sigh*."

Emi: "Alright then. What do we have to do?"

Ingram: "Well for starters, we could do a little housekeeping." 

Ingram: "Let's see. . ."

Ingram: "Well, the foyer needs some sweeping... and there's still empty dishes that need to be collected from the tables. Oh, and the mini library corner could use some dusting. "

Emi: ". . ."

Emi: "We still have to do all that. . .?"

Ingram: "Mmhm."

Ingram: "I know it's a lot, but we have all day to get it done. I'll let you choose what you want to start with."

Emi: "Urgh. . . I guess it has to be done one way or another."

Emi: "Hold on a minute. . ."

Emi: "What about you? What are you gonna be doing?"

Ingram: "Well, someone has to be there to handle the customers right? {w=0.3}I'll be doing my barista duties and manning the cash register."

Ingram: "You're still learning the ropes, so I don't think it's a good idea to leave you to those tasks just yet."

Ingram: "At least, not until you're more comfortable with where everything is."

Emi: "(Hmm. . . that's fair, I guess that makes sense.)"

Ingram: "Alright, let's get down to business then. {w=0.5}You can find anything you need at the back room."

Emi: "Yes boss!"

*I pulled up my sleeves in an attempt to pump myself up, as a chuckle escaped Ingram's mouth.*

*He was clearly amused.*

Emi: "(. . . Sometimes I wonder if he's secretly enjoying this.)"

Ingram: "Oh by the way, you might meet some of the others who also live around Yuugen house."

Ingram: "They tend to lounge around the cafe at this time."

Ingram: "It might be a good chance for you to introduce yourself to them and get to know some people."

Emi: "(Hmm, that's true. {w=0.3}It would be nice to get to know who I'll be living with.)"

Emi: "What are their names?"

Ingram: "There's Kai, Annelise and Akira. I've told them about you before, so they should be aware of who you are."

Ingram: "If you haven't met any of them already, today might be your chance. I'm sure they'll be happy to meet you."

Emi: "Kai, Annelise and Akira... alright, I'll remember that."

Emi: "Well then, I'll be back soon!"

Ingram: "Sounds good. I'll be right here if you need anything."

Emi: "Alright! Let's get started."
