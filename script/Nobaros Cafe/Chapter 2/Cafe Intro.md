Emi: "Thank you for coming!"

Emi: "(Phew, that's the last customer! I can finally catch my breath. . .)"

*A bell chimes at the front of the store, signaling the end of the chaotic lunch hour.*

*The cafe had been busier than usual. The morning hours were peaceful, with a few regulars popping in for their usual coffee or bagel.*

*As the sun rose higher in the sky, more and more customers trickled in, looking for a refreshment to enjoy.*

*Before I knew it, the store had filled up in the blink of an eye. I was scrambling in every direction, taking orders and relaying them to Ingram. Somehow, I managed to survive. Barely.*

*I plop myself down at an empty table, stretching my arms up in the air to relieve the tension in my muscles.*

*Suddenly, a small poke taps at my shoulder, prompting me to look back. Ingram had come from behind the counter, with two icy drinks in hand and a pleased smile on his face.*

Ingram: "Good job with the lunch rush. You held up pretty well out there."

Ingram: "Here, I made some iced coffee for us. Think of it as a little treat for working so hard. Drink up and rehydrate yourself."

*Ingram takes the seat in front of me, passing one of the drinks over to me. Taking the glass in hand, I start taking modest sips to avoid spilling coffee on myself.*

Emi: "(Oh? This coffee...)"

*My tastebuds are greeted by a pleasant, sweet taste. Ingram had mixed some vanilla syrup into the coffee. In an instant, my sweet tooth kicks in, tempting me to devour the whole thing.*

*I indulge in the icy goodness and small sips quickly turn into bigger gulps. Next thing I know, there are only a few ice cubes remaining at the bottom of my glass. I let out a satisfied sigh.*

Emi: "Thanks for the drink, I really needed that!"

*I look at Ingram, who is still finishing his drink. The ice cubes in his drink make a distinct clink as he downs the rest of it.*

*He's awfully calm and collected, far from what I'd imagine from someone who also went through the same chaos I experienced earlier.*

Emi: "You know Ingram, you're really impressive."

Emi: "You handled yourself so well behind the counter. I never even knew a cafe could get that busy!"

*Ingram chuckles as he sets his glass down with a solid thud.*

Ingram: "It's around this time that things start to really pick up the pace. It gets pretty intense sometimes."

Ingram: "But one way or another, I've gotten used to it. It's nothing much really."

Ingram: "But don't worry. With time, you'll be able to breeze right through the rush hours too."

*I gulp as Ingram smiles at me. Maybe he just means well, but the smile feels kind of. . . intimidating.*

*The idea of being able to deal with so many orders at once still seems like a faraway dream for me.*

Emi: "(Maybe in a million years, sure. . .)"

*Ingram gets up from the table, collecting the two glasses as he heads back to the counter. I quickly follow suite, rejuvenated from the little coffee break.*

Ingram: "Well then, now that we've gotten a chance to catch our breath, we can focus on other things."

*I nearly choke at Ingram's words.*

Emi: "Huh?! Say that again? There's still more?"

Ingram: "Hm? Of course, we're only halfway through the day. There's still lots to do."

*I feel my heart sink. The happy, nonchalant mood from earlier disappears as I'm reminded that the day isn't over yet.*

*I sneak a peek over at Ingram, who's already starting to wipe down the counter tops and fill the coffee grinders.*

Emi: "(. . . is it just me? Why does he look so happy about this?)"

Emi: ". . . *Sigh*."

Emi: "Alright then. What do we have to do?"

*Ingram looks straight at me, his smug smile not budging a single bit. He's dead serious. Maybe even a bit sadistic.*

Ingram: "Well for starters, there's a little housekeeping that needs to be done." 

Ingram: "Let's see. . ."

Ingram: "Well, the foyer needs some sweeping. . . and there's empty dishes that need to be collected from the tables. Oh, and the library corner could use some dusting. "

Emi: ". . ."

Emi: "We still have to do all that. . .?"

Ingram: "Mmhm. You'll never run out of things to do around here."

Ingram: "I know it's a lot, but we have all day to get it done. I'll let you choose what you want to start with."

Emi: "Urgh. . . well, I guess it has to be done one way or another."

Emi: "What about you then? What are you gonna be doing?"

Ingram: "Well, someone has to be there to handle the customers right? I'll be doing my barista duties and manning the cash register."

Ingram: "You're still learning the ropes, so I don't think it's a good idea to leave you to those tasks just yet."

Ingram: "At least, not until you're more comfortable with where everything is."

Emi: "Oh. . . I guess that makes sense."

Ingram: "Alright, let's get down to business then. I'm gonna go refill some of the pastries in the display case. You can find anything you need at the back room."

Emi: "Ah, yes boss!"

*As Ingram heads over to the other side of the counter, I turn around to look for supplies in the back.*

Emi: "(Okay, let's do this! I should just focus on one thing at a time. This will all be over in the blink of an eye.)"

*I smack my face twice in an attempt to pump myself up.

Ingram: ". . .pfft."

*A snicker creeps up from behind. I spin around, finding myself face to face with Ingram once again.*

*He covers his mouth in a futile attempt to stifle his laugh. I could see his entire body shaking to keep it in as I feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment.*

Ingram: "S-sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your. . ."

Emi: "I thought you went to go fill up the display case!"

Ingram: "I was going to, but I forgot to tell you something."

Ingram: "Though I didn't expect you to slap yourself as soon as I turned my back. . ."

*Ingram nearly slips at the end of his sentence, but manages to keep himself together.*

Emi: "(. . . isn't he enjoying this a little too much?)"

*I feel the burning sensation from my cheeks spread up to my ears. I just wanna jump in a hole and bury myself six feet under. I better change the subject before he says anything else.*

Emi: "A-anyway! What was it that you wanted to tell me?"

Ingram: "Right, I wanted to let you know that you might meet some of the others who also live around Yuugen House."

Ingram: "They tend to lounge around the cafe at this time."

Ingram: "It's a good chance for you to introduce yourself and get to know them a bit."

Emi: "That's fair. What are their names?"

Ingram: "There's Kai, Annelise and Akira. I've mentioned you before, so they should be aware of who you are."

Ingram: "If you haven't met any of them already, today might be your chance. I'm sure they'll be happy to meet you."

Emi: "Kai, Annelise and Akira. . . alright, I'll remember that."

Emi: "Well then, I'll be back soon!"

Ingram: "Sounds good. I'll be right here if you need anything. Just don't go beating yourself up unprompted again."

Emi: "Ahhh!! Stop bringing it up!"

*Ingram smiles as I try and shoo him away.*

*Once he's out of sight, I then make my way over to the back storage room.*

Emi: "Whoa! This place is surprisingly clean."

*I'm pleasantly surprised by the level of organization inside the storage room.*

*There are a whole bunch of cleaning supplies that looked untouched. Running a finger along one of the shelves, I find that there's not a speck of dust to be found. The place was absolutely spotless.*

Emi: "(Did Ingram do all of this too? He really is on a different level!)"

*I look around for things I would need to finish my chores, finding a broom in the corner, feather duster hanging on the wall and some neatly folded rags on a shelf.*

Emi: "(Hmm. . . what to do first?)"
