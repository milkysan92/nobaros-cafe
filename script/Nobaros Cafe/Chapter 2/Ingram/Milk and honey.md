# Milk and honey

*I grab the bottle of milk, craving its coolness against my warm skin after a bath.*

Emi: "(I'll just savour this moment! If someone wants milk later, I'll apologize and go buy more with Ingram sometime. . .)"

Emi: "(Let's find something to pour this into first. . .)"

*As I search around for a mug, I'm reminded of the warm milk that Ingram prepared for me a while back.*

Emi: "(Hmm, warm milk doesn't sound that bad. The milk he made that time felt extra comforting, it'd be the perfect bedtime drink!)"

*I place a mug on the counter, and begin hunting for a saucepan to heat the milk.*

*As I begin digging through the pots and pans in one of the bottom cupboards, I spot Ingram entering the kitchen out of the corner of my eye.*

Ingram: ". . .Emi? What are you up to?"

Emi: "Oh, Ingram! Good timing, I was just thinking of  having some milk before bed!"

Emi: "I'm looking for a saucepan to make the sweet milk you made last time. Do you know where it might be? I can't seem to find it."

Ingram: "Ah, good timing. I was just craving some spiced milk myself."

Emi: "Spiced milk? That sounds good, can I try some?"

Ingram: "Sure, I can make some for you too."

*Ingram crouches next to me and rummages through, effortlessly pulling out a saucepan out of nowhere.*

Ingram: "Here's the saucepan by the way, it was just pushed all the way in the back corner there."

Emi: "What? How'd you find that so quickly? I didn't even see it!"

*Ingram shrugs as we stand to our feet, placing the saucepan on the stovetop.*

Ingram: "Just a hunch. If you weren't able to find it right away, then it was likely hidden somewhere deeper in there."

Emi: "(. . .Does his spirit guide powers give him magical investigation skills too? What is this sorcery?)"

*I grab another mug for Ingram as he pours the remaining milk into the saucepan and turns on the heat.*

Emi: "So what's this spiced milk drink you're making?"

Ingram: "That's the idea. By infusing a variety of spices with milk, you'll get an interesting twist that slightly resembles chai tea."

Emi: "Oh, that sounds good! So almost like a chai milk tea then?"

Ingram: "You can think of it that way. Just take out the tea part and that's pretty much what it is."

Emi: "Okay, I look forward to it! What spices do you need? I can go grab them while the milk is still boiling."

Ingram: "Sure, can you grab me some dried chili peppers, black pepper and cayenne?"

Emi: ". . ."

Emi: ". . .Are you trying to put me to sleep forever?"

*Seemingly amused by my reaction, he smirks with a mischievous glint in his eyes.*

Ingram: "Here, why don't you watch the pot? I'll go grab them myself."

*Ingram hands me a wooden spoon as he pulls out a number of spice jars from the pantry. Once the milk starts simmering, he returns and sets them nearby on the countertop.*

Emi: "(Cloves, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and vanilla. Huh, there's more spices than I expected.)"

*As I slowly stir the milk, Ingram takes a spoon and carefully measures out each spice, before plopping them into the pot.*

*With each addition, the milk's white colour turns into a darker shade of speckled brown, and the exotic aroma from the pot grows a tad more complex.*

*In a matter of minutes, the milk infuses with the spices and Ingram pours it into the mugs. Swirling trails of steam emerge from the drink, tempting me to dig right in.*

Ingram: "Wait, it's not ready yet."

Emi: "Huh?"

*Ingram stops me just as I reach for one of the mugs, halting me right in my tracks.*

*With a jar of honey in hand, he stirs a dollop into each of our mugs, the golden texture disappearing into the creamy milk.*

*Once the honey is dissolved, he passes a mug over to me.*

Ingram: "It wasn't sweetened yet. I just mixed some honey in."

Emi: "Oh, thank you."

Ingram: "Of course, I wouldn't want you spitting it out all over the kitchen."

Emi: "Hey, I wouldn't do that! You went through all that effort of preparing it for me after all."

Ingram: "Okay, but you'd make a face for sure, knowing your sweet tooth."

Emi: ". . .I can't deny that."

Ingram: "I thought so."

*Ingram smiles as he tastes his drink. I follow suit, bringing the mug to my lips. After blowing a bit, I take a generous sip.*

*The warmth of the milk envelops my taste buds, carrying with it the rich, earthy notes of cloves.*

*There's a subtle sweetness from the cinnamon and honey, and a gentle heat from the ginger. A hint of nutmeg adds depth to the flavour, while the vanilla brings it all together with its delectable essence.*

Emi: "(So warm! It feels so cozy.)"

*I smile in delight, pleased by my choice to heat the milk instead of drinking it cold.*

Emi: "Thank you for teaching me how to make this, Ingram. You always know how to make such comforting drinks, they really warm me up."

Ingram: "Good, that's another drink you can make if you ever need a pick-me-up."

*Ingram falls quiet, and we continue drinking.*

*As I stare down at my mug, I'm reminded of all the ways Ingram has helped me since arriving in Nobaros.*

*Although the currently circumstance is a heavy topic to brood over, I find myself growing accustomed to this place.*

Emi: ". . .Thank you."

Ingram: ". . .Another thanks? You just said that."

Emi: "No, I meant to say. . .thank you for everything so far.  I just wanted to say that I really appreciate all the help you've given me."

Ingram: ". . ."

Ingram: "It's no problem. What kind of spirit guide would I be if I left you to deal with this all on your own?"

Ingram: "It's my responsibility to help you become comfortable here."

*He takes another sip of his milk, another moment of silence settling between us.*

*Although his words brush off the sentiment as another part of his duties, the surprised look in his eyes gives him away.*

Ingram: ". . .Actually, I should be the one thanking you."

Emi: "Thanking me? For what?"

*My heart skips a beat as I wait for his answer. He hesitates, his expression thoughtful, before he speaks again.*

Ingram: "For helping me. In more ways than you think."

Ingram: "I'm sure you must've noticed but. . .it's been kind of weird, having to work with someone else for a change."

Ingram: "Sure, there's the occasional vagabond during spirit guiding, but there's not much interaction happening there."

Ingram: "Nobody goes into it as enthusiastically as you. And you always serve customers with a smile on your face at the cafe."

Ingram: "I'm used to handling all that stuff alone, but you take it a step further and add a touch of humanity to it. And for that, I'm thankful for your presence."

Emi: ". . .I see. I'm glad to hear that."

*I can't help but smile at Ingram's words, feeling a warm sense of satisfaction wash over me. It's humbling to hear how much of an impact I've had on him, and that my actions are actually helping.*

*We savour the rest of our drinks in peace, our voices disappearing into the dead of night as we bask in the moonlight shining through the window.*

Emi: "Have a good night, Ingram. Thanks again for the milk."

Ingram: "You too. Remember that we have another pastry training session tomorrow, so be sure to get some rest."

*With a final smile, the both of us head up to our rooms to retire for the night.*
