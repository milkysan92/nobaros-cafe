# First aid
Emi: "I want to test out the almond croissants!"

Ingram: "Alright, let's do that then."

*Ingram rises and collects the recipe drafts. He places the one he just finished on the counter, while storing the rest away in a drawer.*

*I join him at the counter, watching as he takes out a large packet of sliced almonds.*

Ingram: "So the first step is to toast some of these in the oven. While that's happening, we'll be making two things: sugar syrup and almond cream."

Ingram: "Could I leave you to make the sugar syrup?"

Emi: "Yeah, that should be okay! How do I prepare it though?"

Ingram: "Here's the recipe. The syrup instructions are this paragraph down here."

*He hands me the piece of paper from the counter.*

*As I scan through the ingredients and instructions, I find myself admiring how elegant his handwriting looks.*

*Each step is clearly outlined with neatly written letters that could pass off as printed font.*

Ingram: "Do the instructions make sense? Need me to clarify anything?"

Emi: "O-oh, no, it's good! In fact, your writing is really easy to understand. I'm blown away."

Ingram: "That's good. I tried to make it so that anyone would easily be able to pick this recipe up and follow it."

Ingram: "Let's get started with the baking then."

*As the almonds sit in the oven, a rich, nutty fragrance fills the kitchen. Before long, we finish the sugar syrup and almond cream.*

Ingram: "Now's the fun part, the assembly."

*Ingram pulls out a basket of croissants.*

Ingram: "These are leftovers from yesterday. I figured we could make use of them."

Emi: "Eh? We're not using fresh croissants?"

Ingram: "Nope. The key to good almond croissants is to use ones that are a day old."

Ingram: "The idea is to make a croissant that's crunchy on the outside, yet soft and fluffy on the inside."

Ingram: "Since old ones soak up more sugar syrup, it's easier to achieve that texture with them."

Emi: "Oh, that's pretty neat! So this is a good way of turning something that might've been wasted into something delightful."

Ingram: "Exactly. It reduces the amount of food being thrown out."

*I stand in front of Ingram, staring intently as I mirror each of his movements.*

*He takes one of the croissants and cuts it in half. He demonstrates where to spread the almond cream, then finished by sprinkling crushed almonds on top.*

Emi: "How does this look?"

Ingram: "Not too shabby. You've got the hang of it."

Emi: "(Yay! Looks like I'm doing well so far.)"

*I smile, mentally cheering in excitement as we work through the basket. With the both of us, the pile of croissants disappear in no time.*

Emi: "Into the oven we go. . . and set!"

*After sliding the croissants into the oven, I set the timer and sit at the dining table, eagerly waiting for them to finish.*

Ingram: "Nice work. Now we wait 15 minutes, and they'll be ready."

*Ingram joins me, bringing over a plate of triangular rice balls, wrapped in pieces of dried seaweed.*

Ingram: "Here's some onigiri by the way. It was hard to find time to make lunch since we were baking, but I figured it'd be good to at least eat something."

Emi: "Oh, thanks! I appreciate it."

*Feeling a bit peckish, I happily grab one and dig in. The seaweed crinkles as my teeth sink in, melding with the slightly sticky rice.*

*As we enjoy our small lunch, my eyes fall on the clock.*

Emi: "Whoa, it's already been more than an hour since we started! I would've thought that was like 30 minutes."

Ingram: "Yeah, time really flies when baking."

Emi: "If that's the case, how do you manage to make so many pastries for the cafe?"

Ingram: "I manage what I'm able to, but I don't make every single item you see on display."

Ingram: "Part of the menu comes from other bakeries in the area. That way, I'm able to maintain a good selection at the cafe and help the bakeries spread themselves out."

Emi: "That makes sense, so both of you benefit from it!"

Emi: "Although, if my memories told me anything, it's hard to find personal time when you're so busy."

Emi: "What do you usually do in your spare time?"

Ingram: "Hmm, if I have any. . . find ways to stay productive, I guess. Maybe catch up on things I couldn't get to before."

Emi: "That doesn't sound like a break! You're just constantly working yourself."

Emi: "You should schedule a day to take care of yourself, or you're going to get hurt at some point!"

*I nag Ingram, rendering him speechless for a brief moment. I stare at him dead in the eyes, trying to convey how serious I'm being.*

*He turns his head and nudges over, increasing the space between us. Rubbing the back of his neck, he reassumes his usual smile.*

Ingram: ". . . If you're so insistent, maybe I'll consider sometime. Thanks for the concern."

Emi: "(Is he always this careless. . .? Just because he can handle it doesn't mean he should constantly be testing his limits. . .)"

*Just then, the timer goes off with a loud ring, startling the both of us.*

Emi: "The croissants are done! I'll go take them out."

*I jump out of my seat. Spotting a pair of oven mitts lying near the stovetop, I grab them and open up the oven.*

Ingram: ". . .!"

Ingram: "Wait, Emi! Those oven mitts are-!"

Emi: "OW!"

*As soon as I touch the baking tray, a searing pain shoots my right hand. I immediately yelp  and let go, my vision blurring with tears.*

*In the blink of an eye, Ingram is by my side, pulling me over to the sink. He turns the taps all the way, drenching my hand in cool water.*

*It's then that I realize Ingram's face is right beside mine, brows furrowed as he concentrates on my hand.*

Ingram: ". . . Keep your hands under the water for the next little while. I'll go take the croissants out."

Emi: ". . . Huh? Oh, right. Got it."

*With a thick dishcloth in hand, he places the croissants on the stovetop, leaving them to cool down.*

*He leaves for a while. After a while, the pain lessens slightly and I collect my bearings. Ingram then returns with a first aid kit and a bottle of lotion in hand.*

Ingram: "How are you feeling?"

Emi: "A little better now, thanks to the water."

*I take my hand out of the water, drying it with a paper towel.*

*Ingram reappears beside me, setting the first aid kit down as he takes my hand.*

Emi: "Ouch!"

Ingram: "Sorry, are you okay? Did that hurt a lot?"

Emi: "I'm okay. It just stung a bit when you touched it for a second there."

Ingram: "Okay, I'll be careful."

*He inspects the injury. The base of my hand is pink and slightly tender to the touch.*

Ingram: ". . . It looks a bit swollen, but thankfully, no blisters."

*He proceeds to apply aloe vera lotion, making sure to use light pressure so as to not hurt me.*

Emi: "(He's working so gently. I almost don't feel him treating my hand.)"

*His hands feel rough to the touch, perhaps as a result of all the cafe responsibilities he goes through. But despite that, there's also a kind warmth to his touch.*

*As he wraps my hand in gauze, my mind drifts to the conversation from earlier, recalling how I was just lecturing him to not get hurt.*

Emi: "(I really jinxed it. How could I have burned myself right after saying that? Now I look like a hypocrite. . .)"

*As if reading my mind, Ingram looks up and smiles at me.*

Ingram: "It's a bit odd. I could've sworn that just a few minutes ago, I was just being lectured on not getting hurt by a certain someone. . ."

*A fierce blush spreads across my cheeks like wildfire. I turn my head away, attempting to avoid eye contact.*

Emi: "I-I don't know what you're talking about!"

*He chuckles, adjusting the gauze in my hand.*

Emi: ". . ."

Emi: "I know what you're going to say. It's my fault, and I should've checked the oven mitts more carefully."

Ingram: ". . . No, that's not true. I'm the one who should be apologizing."

Emi: "What?"

Ingram: "Those oven mitts were getting worn out. I placed them there to remind myself to get replacements."

*He shows me the oven mitts, revealing a frayed patch in the middle of one of them.*

Ingram: "This patch here must've been what caused it. It's easy to miss at first glance."

Ingram: ". . . I'm sorry. If I had just communicated better, you wouldn't have burned yourself."

Ingram: "I should've told you about them right away."

Emi: ". . ."

Emi: ". . . Well, earlier, when I was distracted by the pain, you ran water over it right away."

Emi: "If it weren't for you, I could've been in a much worse condition right now."

Emi: "So. . . thank you. Don't beat yourself up over it."

Ingram: ". . . I see."

Ingram: "I'm finished wrapping your hand. How's the tightness?"

Emi: "It feels fine. Thanks for doing this for me."

*Ingram nods with a slight smile, putting away the first aid kit.*

*We check on the croissants, plating a few of the ones that have already cooled down.*

*As Ingram sprinkles powdered sugar on top, I salivate at the buttery aroma, tempted to steal one.*

Ingram: "You should have the first bite."

Emi: "Really? May I?!"

Ingram: "Of course. You worked hard on these. Even your burned hand is a testament to that."

Emi: "Well then, don't mind if I do!"

*I take one of the croissants and bite into it, catching the crumbs with my other hand.*

*The outer flaky layers crackle under my teeth, exposing a pillowy texture inside. The richness of the butter compliments the subtle sweetness of the sugar and almond cream, giving a mouthfeel that feels divine.*

Emi: "These are amazing! I think this recipe is a big success!"

Ingram: "You think so? Let me have a try."

Ingram: ". . ."

Ingram: "It's pretty good. I think this could become popular."

Ingram: "Let's get everyone downstairs to have a try. It'd be good to get some more opinions on this."

Emi: "I agree! I think it'd be great to share this with them."

Kai: "Wow! I love this, the texture's so addicting!"

Annelise: "Mmm! I think this almond cream is really good. Although it's not too sweet, it goes so well with the croissant!"

Akira: "Actually, I like that you held back on the sweetness. It's a nice twist on your average croissant."

Emi: "(They like it! It's a big success!)"

*A sense of pride fills me, and I whip my head towards Ingram, barely able to contain myself.*

*With a smile, he nods at me with an acknowledging look.*

Ingram: "Well then, it's about time I start preparing dinner."

Ingram: "Try not to eat too many of the croissants, or else you'll be too full to eat more later."

Kai: "Ah, it's fine, I've got a big stomach! I'll have enough room."

*As Kai reaches for another croissant, Ingram swipes the plate out of his reach.*

Ingram: "No, that's not happening. You'll spoil your appetite."

Kai: "Aw, come on! Just one more?"

Ingram: "*No.*"

*They start glaring at each other, each refusing to look away or give an inch. Kai lunges forward, attempting to grab a croissant, but misses as Ingram moves the plate further way.*

*I watch as they fight each other over the croissants, with Kai's hands swiping the air and Ingram narrowly avoiding them with his sharp reflexes.*

Emi: "(Oh boy, here we go again. . .)"

*I make my way to the common area, deciding to relax away from the chaos. As I sink into a sofa, I stare at my bandaged hand.*

Emi: "(Even though it hurt so much earlier, I've already forgotten the pain. All I remember is Ingram taking care of me.)"

Emi: ". . ."

*Curiosity getting the better of me, I poke at the bandaged area. A sharp pain shoots through my hand, and I recoil, instantly jerking my finger back.*

Emi: "(Ow, ow, ow. . . Nope, I lied. I remember the pain now.)"

Emi: "(I hope this gets better soon. It'll be annoying having to deal with this for the next little bit.)"
