# About Ingram

Emi: "Ingram, is there nobody else working here?"

Ingram: "Hm? Yes, that's right. It's just me."

Emi: "Don't you ever get tired or burned out from managing everything?"

Emi: "I know you said it comes down to finding the right rhythm or being organized. . . but at some point, there's got to be a limit, no?"

*Ingram shakes his head, turning around to face me as he leans against the counter.*

Ingram: "It's one of the perks of being a spirit guide."

Ingram: "As someone whose responsibility is to help people find their last joy in life on a regular basis, I need to be able to keep up with my duties."

Ingram: "As a result, my constitution is a bit different than yours."

Emi: "Does that mean you never get tired then?"

Ingram: "I still do, but it takes a lot more to get me to that state."

*Despite what Ingram tells me, I still find it hard to believe his words. He must've *

Ingram: "Things are fine as is."
