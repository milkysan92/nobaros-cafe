# About Ingram

Emi: "Ingram, I'm curious about something."

Ingram: "Of course, what's on your mind?"

Emi: "I was just wondering. . .is there nobody else working here? Is it really just you taking on everything?"

Ingram: "Yes, that's right."

Emi: "Don't you ever get tired or burned out?"

Emi: "Earlier, you said it comes down to finding the right rhythm or being organized. . ."

Emi: "But at some point, there has to be a limit, no?"

*Ingram shakes his head, his gaze shifting slightly.*

Ingram: "It's one of the perks of being a spirit guide."

Ingram: "You see, my constitution is a bit different than yours."

Ingram: "As you've seen so far, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with spirit guiding, especially since it's on a regular basis."

Ingram: "My powers allow me to be able to keep up with everything."

Emi: "Does that mean you never get tired then?"

Ingram: "Well, think of it this way. It still requires effort to get all these tasks done, but in completing them, I don't expend as much energy as a regular person would."

Ingram: "So with that being said, it's not often that I get that tired."

Emi: "I guess I can understand that, but that still leaves the question of why there's no other workers here. You've never thought about enlisting someone to divide up the work?"

*He sets down his cloth, leaning casually against the counter. There's a contemplative look on his face, as if weighing his words carefully.*

Ingram: ". . .I could never choose to burden someone with that responsibilty."

Ingram: "People don't come to Nobaros of their own accord. Why would they want to work while they're here?"

Ingram: "Not that I'd reject the help if it's offered, but it doesn't sit well with me to reach out and force these responsibilities on someone else."

Ingram: "That's why I was surprised when you told me you wanted to help out."

Ingram: "You're the first one to ever ask ."

*Ingram looks at me with a steady gaze, his voice devoid of any doubt.*

*His sincerity invokes a wave of emotions within me. It's disheartening that no one ever thought to offer some help around the cafe.*

*Although it's weird to think considering the circumstances, I'm grateful to be here.*

Emi: "(Hopefully, I can start getting the hang of things quickly. The more I can take on, the less tasks he'll have to deal with.)"
