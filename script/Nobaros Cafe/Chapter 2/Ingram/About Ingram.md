# About Ingram

Emi: "Ingram, I'm curious about something."

Ingram: "Of course, what's on your mind?"

Emi: "I was just wondering. . .is there nobody else working here? Is it really just you taking on everything?"

Ingram: "Yes, that's right."

Emi: "Don't you ever get tired or burned out?"

Emi: "Earlier, you said it comes down to finding the right rhythm or being organized. . ."

Emi: "But at some point, there has to be a limit, no?"

*Ingram shakes his head, his gaze shifting slightly.*

Ingram: "It's one of the perks of being a spirit guide."

Ingram: "You see, my constitution is a bit different than yours."

Ingram: "As you've seen so far, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with spirit guiding, especially since it's on a regular basis."

Ingram: "My powers allow me to be able to keep up with everything."

Emi: "Does that mean you never get tired then?"

Ingram: "Well, think of it this way. It still requires effort to get all these tasks done, but I don't expend as much energy as a regular person would."

Ingram: "So with that being said, it's not often that I get that tired."

Emi: "I see. . .well if you say so, then I'll take your word for it."

Emi: "But that doesn't completely answer the question of why there's no other staff here. You've never thought about enlisting someone to divide up the work?"

*Ingram sets down his cloth, leaning casually against the counter. There's a contemplative look on his face, as if weighing his words carefully.*

Ingram: ". . .I could never choose to burden someone with that responsibilty."

Ingram: "People don't come to Nobaros of their own accord. Why would they want to work while they're here?"

Ingram: "It just doesn't sit well with me to force these responsibilities on someone else."

Emi: "Then what about me? I asked you if I could help out and now here I am, doing exactly that."

Ingram: "Well, it's not that I'd reject the help if it's offered."

Ingram: "But you're the first person to ever ask."

Emi: "Really? Not a single person?"

Ingram: "Really."

Ingram: "That's why I was surprised when you told me you wanted to help out."

*Ingram looks at me with a steady gaze, his voice devoid of any doubt.*

*An uncomfortable feeling stirs within me as I realize the sincerity in Ingram's words. It's disheartening to think that no one ever thought to offer some help around the cafe.*

Emi: "(Are people really that heartless. . .?)"

Emi: "(. . .No, that's not right.)"

Emi: "(It's not that they're heartless. Most people would be too focused on recovering their memories. Working at the cafe wouldn't normally cross their minds.)" 

Emi: "(I can't blame them, but still. . .)"

Emi: "(. . .It's a good thing that I'm here. Although it's weird to think that, considering my circumstances.)"

*I steal a glance at Ingram, who notices my silence.*

Ingram: "Are you okay? You got silent all of a sudden."

Ingram: "I hope you're not regretting your decision."

Ingram: "But if you're having second thoughts, you should let me know and I can-"

Emi: "N-no, there's no need for that!"

Emi: "I was just thinking to myself a bit."

Ingram: "Is that so? A penny for your thoughts?"

Emi: "Well. . .I was just thinking about how glad I am to be here, to help lighten your load a bit."

*Ingram's eyes widen, clearly taken aback by my response. There's a subtle shift in his expression, a brief moment of surprise that quickly fades. As soon as I register the change, he resumes the same smile as before.*

Ingram: "That'll depend on your capabilities. If you manage to learn things quickly, then maybe that might be true."

Ingram: "You'll just have to work extra hard in that case."

Emi: "Yes, of course! I made sure to do exactly that when I was finishing the tasks you assigned to me earlier."
