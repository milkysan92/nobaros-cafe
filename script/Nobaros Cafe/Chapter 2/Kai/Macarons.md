# Macarons
*I take the macarons and carefully place them in a small bag, making sure it's sealed shut. With the bag in hand, I make my way back to the cafe entrance.*

Emi: "(Huh? Where'd he go? I thought I told him to wait here.)"

*I scan the cafe, searching for any sign of Kai.*

*Suddenly, a pair of hands slam down on my shoulders, causing me to gasp and drop the macarons.*

*Kai bursts into laughter, clearly amused by his prank.*

Kai: "Gotcha, Emi! Sorry, I couldn't resist."

*Turning to face him, I try to hide my surprise with a glare.*

Emi: "Kai, you scared me!"

Kai: "Aw, come on, it was just a little joke. Here, let me make it up to you."

*He wipes a tear from his eye. After composing himself, he picks up the bag of macarons and hands them to me with a sheepish smile.*

Emi: "It isn't very nice to scare someone who went through the trouble of finding food for you."

Kai: "You're right. I promise I'll behave."

Kai: "So what did you end up finding?"

*With a huff, I push the bag of macarons into his arms.*

Emi: "There were some leftover macarons. It probably won't fill you up too much but it was what we had."

*Kai tugs at the bag, peering inside to inspect the macarons. His eyes shine brightly at the sight of them.*

Kai: "Oh sweet! I'll never turn these down, they're my favourite! I've been craving them these days too."

Emi: "I'm glad to hear that you have something nice to eat. Just remember that macarons aren't a good substitute for a meal, so you should eat a proper meal when you can."

Kai: "Don't worry, I'll make sure to eat a big meal when I get home later." 

*Kai laughs as he grabs one of the macarons and take a bite, dancing in excitement. I laugh along with him at how happy he is over a small treat.*

*He eagerly gobbles down, delighting in each bite with animated reactions.*

*In a matter of minutes, he empties the bag and looks almost sad that there aren't any more.*

Kai: "Ahh, that felt so good!"

Kai: "Thanks a lot Emi, that really hit the spot."

Emi: "Wow, you really devoured that bag. I'm surprised you didn't choke on a crumb or something!"

*Kai laughs heartily, a proud glint in his eyes.*

Kai: "What can I say? I like sweets. If you put some in front of me, I guarantee they'll disappear right under your nose."

Emi: "(I guess that's one thing we have in common.)"

Kai: "Alright, now that I've gotten a bite to eat, I'm gonna head out now."

Kai: "It was nice finally meeting you, I'll see you later Emi!"

*Kai excitedly waves as he leaves the cafe, the door chime tinkling behind his departure.*

Emi: "(What a character! I wonder where he gets his energy from.)"

Emi: "(I feel all pumped up now. Let's get onto the next chore!)"
