# Tell Kai
Emi: "Kai, there's a crumb on your cheek."

Kai: "Huh? Where?"

*I point to my cheek, showing him where to wipe. He takes a paper towel from the macaron container and gets rid of the crumb.*

Kai: "Thanks! Hey, you should have one of these macarons too!"

Kai: "It feels weird being the only one finishing the whole box."

Emi: "Sure, I think I packed a little too much to begin with."

*Kai takes the container from me and places one of the macarons in my hands.*

Emi: "(Hmm, now that I think about it, I haven't even tasted these yet. I've been so focused on other people's feedback that I forgot to have one myself.)"

*I bite in, experiencing pure bliss as I chew. The almond shells meld with the buttercream filling, creating a sweet and satisfying mouthfeel that blesses my tongue.*

*Before long, we finish the macarons and make our way home, the sun now starting to set.*

Kai: "By the way, what's for dinner?"

Emi: "Oh, I'm not too sure actually. Ingram didn't mention."

Kai: "Hmm, let's make a bet then! Winner gets the rest of those macarons in your hands."

Emi: "Okay, I'm down!"

Kai: "Sweet! Alright, for my guess, I bet he's making cream stew tonight."

Emi: "What? How'd you come up with that?"

Kai: "Just my gut instinct really. I'm craving some right now."

Emi: "You're just hungry!"

Kai: "Hehe, well, it's a guess nonetheless!"

Kai: "Well then, what do you think he's gonna make? Any guesses?"

Emi: "Hmm. . . then I'm going to say curry rice!"

Kai: "Alright, prepare to lose those macarons."

Emi: "Hey, we aren't even home yet! How are you so sure you're going to win?"

Kai: "I can feel it in my stomach."

Emi: "Hey, no tooting your own horn, haha!"

*I punch his arm, earning a fit of laughter from him. He tries to nuzzle my head as revenge, but I run away before he's able to get a hold of me.*

*For the rest of the way home, we play a little game of tag, laughing every time we catch the other.*
