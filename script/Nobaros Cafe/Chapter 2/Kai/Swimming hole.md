# Swimming hole
Emi: "I want to get some practice with the macarons."

Ingram: "Okay, we can do that."

*Ingram rises to his feet, handing me the macaron recipe as he organizes the recipe drafts into a neat stack.*

*As he stores them away in a kitchen drawer, I make sure to thoroughly wash my hands at the sink. After throwing on an apron, I head over to the countertop and skim through the baking instructions.*

Emi: "(Almond flour, powdered sugar, egg whites. . .)"

Emi: "(. . . Huh? That's it? There's not very many ingredients.)"

Ingram: "You look confused. Is there something wrong with the recipe?"

Ingram: "I can help clarify my handwriting if it's hard to read."

Emi: "Oh, your handwriting's just fine! It's neater than I could ever write."

Emi: "I was just expecting to see a bigger list of ingredients."

Ingram: "Well, macarons are essentially meringue-based almond cookies. Although they have very simple ingredients, they are quite finicky to make."

Emi: "Finicky in what way?"

Ingram: "There's a number of factors. You have to mix them just the right amount, and the room temperature and humidity can also affect their texture."

Ingram: "If you ask me, I think making these will prove to be a good baking challenge for you. I'd be impressed if you manage to pull it off without a hitch."

Emi: "Well then, I'll do my best to follow your instructions!"

*Ingram chuckles as he brings out a sieve and a large mixing bowl.*

Ingram: "Let's get started with prepping the dry ingredients before we get to making the meringue."

Ingram: "First step is to sift almond flour and powdered sugar into this bowl. While you do that, I'll line the baking trays with parchment paper."

Emi: "Got it!"

*As I start measuring out the flour and sugar, Ingram takes out two large trays, placing a piece of parchment paper on each of them.*

*Once I finish sifting, Ingram pulls out a carton of eggs, along with two bowls beside it.

Ingram: "Thanks for sifting. Now that we have that dealt with, we can get to separating the egg whites out."

Emi: "Okay! How do you do that?"

Ingram: "Here, I'll show you a trick."

Ingram: "It's a little messy, but it does make it much easier if you're not very good at working with the egg shells."

*He takes one of the eggs and cracks it right into a bowl. With a fluid motion, he uses a hand to carefully scoop up the yolk and place it in the other bowl.*

Emi: "Ohh, I think I get it. You're basically fishing the egg yolk out."

Ingram: "Yeah, that's the idea. You'll want to spread your fingers out so the egg white can leak through, but not so much that you drop the yolk."

Emi: "Okay, I'll give it a try!"

*With Ingram's demonstration fresh in my mind, I take another egg from the carton and crack it into the egg white bowl.*

*As I dip my hand in and lift the yolk, my skin tingles with goosebumps from how slippery the egg whites are.*

*Translucent liquid oozes through my fingers, each glob plopping into the bowl with a distinct squelch.*

*After draining as much egg white as I could, I plop the yolk into the other bowl.*

Emi: "(I did it!)"

*I glance at Ingram, who nods at my little achievement. We continue working through the rest of the eggs together.*

Ingram: "Alright, onto the meringue now."

Ingram: "We're going to be using the French method, which means we'll be slowly adding sugar while mixing the egg whites."

Emi: "There's another method for making meringue?"

Ingram: "Yes, there's also the Italian method, where you add boiling sugar syrup to the meringue instead of sugar by itself."

Emi: "Oh, I see. How does that affect the macarons?"

Ingram: "French macarons have a slightly crispy texture on the outside, and are soft and chewy on the inside."

Ingram: "On the other hand, Italian macarons are denser and chewier. They're also more stable, so I usually use the Italian method when baking for the cafe."

Ingram: "Since you're still new to this, I chose to teach you using the less complicated French method."

Emi: "Makes sense. I feel like I'd get too hung up on the sugar syrup if we went with the Italian method."

*Ingram places the egg whites in a stand mixer. While the meringue is being whipped up, I measure out some sugar in a small bowl. On Ingram's signal, I add it to the egg whites in small increments.*

*After a couple of minutes, the foamy egg whites transform into beautiful, glossy peaks.*

Ingram: "Now that the meringue's finished, it's time for the macaronage stage."

Emi: "M-macaroni. . .?"

Ingram: "Macaronage. It's where we mix the almond flour mixture into the meringue."

Ingram: "This is a crucial step. If you overmix it, the batter gets too runny and the macaron shells are going to come out flat or hollow."

Ingram: "However, if you don't mix it enough, the dry ingredients won't blend in enough. That'll result in bumpy shells."

Emi: "O-oh. . . Maybe I should let you do the mixing then. That sounds like a lot of pressure."

Ingram: "No, this session is for you to get baking experience. Here, I'll show you how to mix the batter."

*He grabs the bowl and adds part of the almond mixture in. With a spatula, he scoops up the meringue from the bottom of the bowl, bringing it over the top in a smooth, sweeping motion.*

*Each fold is deliberate, as he turns the bowl slightly with his other hand.*

Ingram: "Now you should have a go. Try your best to be consistent and gentle with the folding."

*He gestures for me to take the spatula and bowl.*

Emi: "A-are you sure? But what if I mess it up? Then our whole batch is going to be ruined!"

Ingram: "If that happens, we'll try again. We'll keep redoing it until you get the hang of it."

Emi: "A-aren't we going to run out of eggs though. . .?"

Ingram: ". . .Which should motivate you to do your best each time."

*Ingram smiles, his eyes piercing into me. Although his smile appears kind and inviting, they don't quite reach his eyes.*

Emi: "(The pressure's on. . .)"

*A chill runs down my back. I gulp, wiping my hands on my apron.*

Ingram: ". . .Don't worry about over or under mixing. I'll be watching, so you'll know when to stop."

Ingram: "It's better that you're mixing with confidence."

Emi: "(Then say that earlier!)"

*I take the bowl from Ingram, attempting to mix as he pours in more of the almond mixture.*

*At first, I struggle to get used to the motion, my movements resembling stirring more than scooping.*

*But eventually, I get the hang of it and loosen my grip on the spatula. I find a rhythm and fold away, the batter flowing off my spatula in thick, steady ribbons.*

*While I'm mixing in the rest of the almond mixture, Ingram adds some food colouring. The drop disappears into the batter, and within seconds, a beautiful streak of pink appears.*

*Before long, we finish mixing the batter and quickly pipe it onto the baking sheets.*

Emi: "38, 39. . .40! There's 40 shells in total."

Ingram: "That's a good amount. Now we'll let it air out for around 30 minutes before they go into the oven."

Emi: "Oh, okay. Do they need to rest or something?"

Ingram: "It's so that we get a thin, dry skin on the surface. It essentially helps the macarons bake better."

Ingram: "In the meantime, let's take a quick lunch break and make some buttercream filling afterwards."

Ingram: "I'll go quickly make some onigiri for us."

Emi: "Okay, thank you!"

*With some leftover rice, Ingram mixes some salt into them and scoops some into his hands. He shapes them into little triangles, wrapping them with some dried seaweed.*

Ingram: "Here it is. Sorry that it isn't much, but it was the quickest thing I could make."

Ingram: "It's a little late for lunch, but it'd be good to eat something at least. I'll make sure to make something more hearty for dinner tonight."

Emi: "No worries! We've been busy all day with baking, so it's not like there's a lot of time to make something."

*Feeling a bit peckish, I happily grab one the rice balls and dig in. The seaweed crinkles as my teeth sink in, melding with the slightly sticky rice.*

*As we enjoy our small lunch, my eyes fall on the clock.*

*We work through the rest of the baking process, making the buttercream in the stand mixer and baking the macaron shells. Before I know it, we're ready to assemble.*

Emi: "Ah, they look so good! This is a nice shade of pink."

*I grab a macaron shell and observe it up close. The top is smooth, light reflecting off its baby pink surface. At its base is a ruffled edge, an iconic look to every macaron.*

*Flipping the shell on its back, I pipe some vanilla buttercream onto the base and sandwich it with another shell.*

Emi: "(This looks pretty legit! I'm glad they turned out okay in the end.)"

Akira: "Hey you two, what are you making?"

Ingram: "Emi was practicing how to make macarons. As you can see, we're in the middle of assembling them now."

*Akira enters the kitchen and walks over to us, inspecting the finished sandwiches.*

Akira: "Nicely done, they look similar to the ones at the cafe. I'm impressed."

Emi: "Would you like to try one?"

Akira: "Sure, I'd be happy to."

*I quickly assemble a macaron and offer it to Akira. He smiles and digs in.*

Akira: "Hmm, the texture's pretty nice. The shells are crunchy, but they go well with how the buttercream just melts in your mouth."

*Akira's reaction fills me with a sense of joy, and I fight the urge to do a little celebration dance on the spot.*

Akira: "Though to be honest, I don't eat very many sweet things, so this is a little on the sweeter side for me. But I can see someone like Kai or Annelise enjoying these like no tomorrow."

Ingram: "That's understandable. Thanks for being our first taste tester though."

Ingram: "What are you up to right now? Surely, you didn't come over to have a macaron no?"

Akira: "Haha, well, that certainly wasn't what I had in mind initially."

Akira: "I was just on the rooftop garden, watering the plants. I was going to head back to my room, but I smelled something good and decided to check it out."

Ingram: "I see. If you're heading back up, then could I bother you to take some of these up to Annelise?"

Ingram: "I predict she's somewhere inside her room, reading away."

Akira: "Classic. That is how she is with books."

Akira: "Sure, hand me a plate and I'll bring it with me."

*As Ingram fills up a small plate with some of the finished macarons, I can't help but wonder what Kai's up at this time.*

Emi: "Hey, any of you guys know where Kai is? I haven't seen him all day."

Ingram: "Oh, he left earlier this morning. I think he mentioned something about being at the swimming hole."

Ingram: "He's probably the best person to ask for a taste test."

Akira: "Hmm, that's true. He and Annelise are the biggest sweet tooths around."

Emi: "Really? Then I'll go bring some over to him and get his opinion!"

Emi: "Oh, but I should probably help Ingram assemble the rest of the macarons first."

Ingram: "It's okay, there's just a couple left. You've seen the whole process already, so I think you get the idea."

Ingram: "I'll be making dinner after this, so try not to stay out for too long."

Emi: "Got it! I'll bring Kai back with me then."

Ingram: "Thanks."

*. . .*

*With a small container of macarons in hand, I set off towards the swimming hole.*

*The sun peeks through the trees, casting dappled shadows along the path. The path is riddled with boulders and branches, yet my feet navigate quickly over the uneven terrain.*

Emi: "(I hope he likes these! I'm curious to see his reaction.)"

*Midway into the forest, the path begins to dip slightly. Feeling the pressure on my knees, I slow down, being careful to watch my step.*

Emi: "(. . . Running water! I must be getting close.)"

*As I descend, the surrounding trees thin out, and the sound of water grows stronger.*

*Eventually, I find the pool of water. The ripples on its surface glisten under the sun, and I stand there, admiring the water's turquoise colour.*

Emi: "(Huh? Where's Kai? I thought he was supposed to be somewhere around here.)"

Emi: "(Did I miss him on the way here. . .? No, but I would've seen him on the trail then.)"

Emi: "ACK!"

*Suddenly, a splash of water hits the back of my neck.*

*I flinch, gasping as the icy droplets send a shock through my body. Spinning around, I find Kai with a mischievous grin.*

Emi: "Kai! Couldn't you just say hi to me like a normal person?!"

Kai: "Hehe, sorry, I couldn't pass up the opportunity."

Emi: "*Sigh*. . . Pranks are fine and all, but could you not scare me to death every time I come looking for you?"

Kai: "Alright, alright. I'll actually listen and stop sneaking up on you."

Kai: "You should've seen the way you jumped though! Your reaction was actually so worth it."

Emi: ". . ."

*I glare at Kai as he sheepishly grins.*

*His normally spiky hair is all flat, with water droplets dripping onto the towel wrapped around his neck. Glancing down, my eyes widen and I immediately avert my eyes.*

Emi: "(Right, he was swimming earlier! Of course he wouldn't be wearing a shirt.)"

Kai: "So what brings you here, Emi? You're fully clothed, and it doesn't look like you brought a towel. Clearly, you're not here to swim."

Emi: "Oh right! Earlier, Ingram was teaching me how to make macarons and we were sharing them with the others."

Emi: "Since you were out of the house, I thought I'd bring some to you as well."

Kai: "Homemade macarons?! Really? Can I have one right now?"

Emi: "Yeah sure, they're in this container here. Feel free to take one and tell me what you think."

*I take the container lid off, revealing the macarons I packed earlier. Kai's eyes stretch with amazement, as if he'd just discovered treasure.*

*He takes one of the macarons and takes a bite. The macaron crumbles as his teeth sink in, the smooth exterior cracking with a soft crunch.*

*As he chews, a smile forms on his face and he finishes the rest of the macaron, snatching another one in an instant. He enjoys another bite, shimmying his shoulders like a happy little boy.*

Emi: "H-hey! How am I supposed to get your feedback if you just keep eating?"

Emi: "Wh-what do you think. . .?"

Kai: "Oh, you're looking for feedback? Hmm, well, I think it's great!"

Kai: "The texture's pretty on point, and it's the perfect sweetness."

Kai: "That's pretty hard to do when both the shells and filling contain sugar, but I think it's just the right amount! I could eat these all day!"

Emi: "I'm glad to see that you like it. How about areas I could improve in?"

Kai: "Hmm, well, I'm no pastry chef, but if I really had to give constructive criticism. . . maybe next time, put a little less filling?"

Kai: "The creaminess overpowers the crunchiness a bit, which is a shame because most of the work goes into making the shells."

Emi: "Less filling next time. . . That makes sense!"

Emi: "Thanks so much for the feedback, that was more detailed than I expected! I really appreciate it."

Kai: "Yeah, no problem! Honestly, I've eaten so many of these that I kind of developed a sense of what makes a good macaron."

Kai: "Ingram prevents me from buying out the cafe's stock though. . ."

Emi: "Uh, maybe that's for the better. . . You have to leave some for other customers to enjoy too!"

Kai: "Haha, you're right! I can't imagine how I'd feel if I was in that position. Isn't it so sad when you're craving something, but it ends up being sold out?"

Emi: "Yeah, that would really suck, especially if you were looking forward to it all day!"

*A smile tugs at my lips, feeling a happy sense of relief from Kai's feedback. Somehow, his advice feels especially gratifying.*

Emi: "(Oh? There's a crumb on his cheek. . .)"
