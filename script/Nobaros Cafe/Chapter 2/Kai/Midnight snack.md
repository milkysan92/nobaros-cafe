# Midnight snack
Emi: "(You know what, let's just drink some water and head right to bed afterwards.)"

*I pull the water jug out of the fridge and pour myself a glass, taking a big gulp of the icy cold liquid.*

*As I finish my glass, I savour the refreshing cooling sensation in my stomach.*

Emi: "(Ah, that hits the spot. I guess you can never go wrong with plain old water.)"

*Just then, Kai descends down the stairs and walks through the common area. He looks behind him to see if anybody is around, before taking careful steps into the kitchen.*

Emi: "Kai? What are you doing here?"

Kai: "HYAHH!!"

*Right as Kai makes eye contact with me, he silently screams from shock, his voice hoarse and strained so as to not disturb the peaceful night atmosphere around the house.*

Emi: "Geez, you don't have to look so surprised. It's just me."

Kai: "S-sorry, I didn't notice you. I wasn't expecting anybody to be downstairs."

Emi: "I was here the whole time. . .and why are you speaking so quietly? What are you being all sneaky for?"

Kai: "I was hungry. Thought I'd look around the kitchen and whip something up, but I'm a little scared of being nagged for cooking this late."

Emi: "What? But you ate so much during dinner, how are you not full?"

*Kai's stomach gurgles as he nervously laughs, rubbing the back of his neck.*

Kai: "Well, it is what it is. You heard my stomach."

Kai: "Oh, speaking of which, how'd you like dinner? I know you said it tasted good, but I wanted to hear the full review from the guest of honour."

Emi: "Guest of honour? You think too highly of me, haha."

Emi: "*Ahem*. . .well, I thought it was superb. There was an acceptable amount of sauce and the beef slices were exquisitely tender."

Emi: "I was particularly impressed by how each little vegetable piece was well seasoned. It was truly a magnificent dish."

*As I describe my culinary experience with the haughtiest food critic voice I could muster, Kai's eyes glitter with enthusiasm. At the end of my review, the both of us burst out laughing.*

Kai: "Haha, you make a good food critic impression! You could totally get into a career in acting."

Emi: "Oh, stop pulling my leg! Really though, I appreciate that you guys were willing to get together and cook for me."

Emi: "If anything, I'm just sad that it was all finished before I could take seconds. I'd love to have more."

Kai: "Oh, then you're in for a treat! Since I'm going to be cooking anyways, why don't I make a portion for you too?"

Emi: "Huh? N-no, I think I'm fine. I shouldn't be eating this soon before bed. . ."

*The nikujaga from earlier flashes through my mind, and I start salivating.*

*Against all odds, my stomach grumbles at the thought of eating more delicious food, betraying my own attempt to not indulge.*

Emi: "(Dang it, why did my stomach have to give me away?! I blame food for tasting so good.)"

*I feel a faint heat creep into my cheeks as Kai laughs, wiping a tear from his eye.*

Kai: "Hahaha, it looks like your stomach doesn't agree with you!"

Emi: "Urgh. . .what are you going to make?"

Kai: "Hmm, I'll figure something out! Just sit here and hang tight. I've got you covered."

*Kai sits me down at the dining table as he begins digging through the fridge for ingredients.*

*His movements are natural and fluid, and he doesn't skip a beat in pulling out both a frying pan and a cutting board.*

*He takes one of the aprons hanging off the wall and ties it onto himself in seconds, proceeding to wash his hands and start cutting up tomatoes afterwards.*

*I can't help but stare more attentively than earlier, now that it's only him cooking.*

*It's a bit jarring to see him so focused, considering how all over the place he normally is.*

Emi: "(I didn't expect him to know his way around the kitchen.)"

Emi: "(Does he actually cook often? But I thought Ingram was the one who usually cooks here.)"

Kai: "What's on your mind, Emi? You kind of have an intense look on your face."

Emi: "Eh? Oh, no, don't mind me. I was just thinking about how you seem to really know what you're doing. Are you in the kitchen often?"

Kai: "Hmm, once in a while, I guess?"

Kai: "I don't find cooking too hard honestly. You just gotta be confident in your actions and know how to protect yourself."

Emi: "You make it sound so easy, compared to Annelise earlier. . ."

Kai: "Uh. . .let's not think about that. She's got spirit at least."

Kai: "You might want to cover your ears. This could get a bit noisy."

*Kai throws the tomatoes into the frying pan, and a loud searing noise erupts from the heat.*

*Almost immediately, he throws in a bunch of seasonings and starts stir-frying in a fast-paced manner.*

*I watch in awe as he cooks the rest of the ingredients. Although he's just cooking, his movements are flashy, almost as if he's performing right in front of my eyes.*

Emi: "(I can't wait to see what he makes. . .)"

*After some time, Kai wraps up in the kitchen and approaches the dining table with a steaming hot dish.*

Kai: "Bon appetite, I made an egg and tomato stir-fry!"

*As he sets down the dish, I'm captivated by the sight of it. Fresh, ripe tomato pieces intertwine with velvety scrambled eggs, all enveloped in a glistening sauce.*

*As I marvel at how visually pleasing everything looks, the rich, savoury aroma from the dish makes my taste buds tremble with anticipation.*

*Kai hands me a pair of chopsticks as he takes the seat across from me, setting down a bowl of rice and cooked sausages for himself.*

Kai: "I hope you don't mind, but I gave myself some extra rice and sausages to fill my stomach a bit more."

Emi: "Oh no, it's fine! This is perfect, actually. I'm blown away by how good this looks for just eggs and tomatoes."

Kai: "Hehe, I appreciate the compliment. Go ahead and have a bite!"

*With chopsticks in hand, I extend my arm, grabbing a small piece of tomato and egg in one. As I pop it into my mouth, I dance in delight from the explosion of umami.*

*Although simple, the acidity of the tomatoes melds together with the savouriness of the eggs, coming together to create a wonderful mouthfeel that leaves me satisfied.*

Kai: "So what do you think? Do you like it?"

*I nod excitedly as I happily take another bite, earning a prideful grin from Kai.*

*Pleased by my reaction, he takes his chopsticks and digs into the dish himself, joining me in eating.*

Emi: "I'm surprised! I didn't think you could make such a nice dish with just eggs and tomatoes."

Kai: "Yeah, right? It's ridiculously simple, so it's a really good and easy dish to make if you're ever looking for something to eat."

Kai: "I also tried to make something light and healthy since you were worried about eating so close to bedtime. This way, it shouldn't be as bad on your stomach."

Emi: "Oh, really? I didn't expect you to be so considerate. I mean, you were originally just going to make something for yourself, weren't you?"

Kai: "Haha yeah, at first, I was. But I am the one who dragged you into joining me, so I might as well make it so that the both of us can enjoy ourselves."

*Hearing Kai's words brings a heartwarming smile to my face, touched by his actions.*

Emi: "(He's unexpectedly thoughtful. I thought he'd be the kind of person to just do whatever he feels without regarding other people.)"

Emi: "(Well, he seems to be enjoying the food as much as I am. It feels pretty comfy chatting with him.)"

Kai: "Hey Emi, you seem to like food a lot. What's your favourite thing to eat?"

Emi: "Oh gosh, that's a hard question. There's so many good options to choose from!"

Kai: "Haha, I feel you! When you like everything, how can you make a choice right?"

Kai: "Let me rephrase the question a bit then. What food would you never refuse if it was offered?"

Emi: "Okay, if it was offered to me, then it'd have to be any dessert! I can never resist anything containing sugar, even if it kills me."

Kai: "Oh, so you're a fellow sweet tooth like me then!"

Emi: "Hey, don't compare me to you. At least I like strawberries, they're the best in cakes!"

Kai: "It's not my fault I get stomachaches whenever I eat strawberries!"

Kai: "Besides, it's only fresh strawberries that give me a problem. Strawberry flavoured things are okay."

Emi: "How does that work?!"

Kai: "I don't know, ask my body! It just does what it does."

*The both of us bicker cheerfully as we finish the rest of the meal, discussing all sorts of topics related to desserts.*

*Before long, we wrap up and decide to head up to our rooms to retire for the night.*

Emi: "Thanks for cooking, Kai. That tasted pretty good."

Kai: "Yeah, no problem! Thanks for joining me, we should go check out some of the other food places around here sometime."

Emi: "That sounds fun, I'd be down to! Have a good sleep."

Kai: "You too, good night!"
