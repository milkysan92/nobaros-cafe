# Strawberry tart
*I carefully place the strawberry tart into a mini box, ensuring it's secure before sealing it shut with tape. With the box in hand, I head back to the cafe entrance.*

Emi: "(Huh? Where'd he go? I thought I told him to wait here.)"

*I scan the cafe, searching for any sign of Kai.*

*Suddenly, a pair of hands slam down on my shoulders, causing me to gasp and almost drop the box.*

*Kai bursts into laughter, clearly amused by his prank.*

Kai: "Gotcha, Emi! Sorry, I couldn't resist."

*Turning to face him, I try to hide my surprise with a glare.*

Emi: "Kai, you scared me!"

Kai: "Aw, come on, it was just a little joke."

*He wipes a tear from his eye, looking at me with a sheepish smile.*

Emi: "It isn't very nice to scare someone who went through the trouble of finding food for you."

Kai: "You're right, I'm sorry. I promise I'll behave."

Kai: "So what did you end up finding?"

*With a huff, I push the box containing the strawberry tart into his arms.*

Emi: "There was a leftover strawberry tart. It probably won't fill you up too much but it was what we had."

*Kai carefully opens the box, peering inside to inspect the strawberry tart. For a brief moment, his face contorts, but he quickly covers it with a polite smile.*

Kai: "Oh, thanks! I, uh, appreciate that you took the time and effort to find something for me."

Emi: "Is something wrong? You don't look very happy."

*Kai averts his gaze, unable to look me in the eye. He hesitates to answer.*

Kai: "The truth is, I'm not a very big fan of strawberries. They just don't sit well with me."

Emi: "Oh shoot, I'm so sorry! I should've asked you if you had any preferences. I can go grab you something else!"

Kai: "No, don't worry about it! I can still eat it. I'll just make sure to eat a big meal when I get home later."

Emi: "Are you sure? You don't have to force yourself."

Kai: "Really, it's okay. Don't feel too bad, you didn't know any better."

*Despite my insistence, Kai refuses to accept anything else and makes do with the strawberry tart.*

*To prove his point, he take the tart and bites out of it.*

Emi: "W-wait, you don't have to-!"

*He forces a smile and shows me a thumbs up, signaling that he's okay. But the expression on his face says otherwise.*

Kai: ". . .mmph!"

Emi: "(!!!)"

Emi: "(Oh no! It's stuck in his chest!)"

*Panicked, I quickly run to the counter, filling a glass with water to help Kai wash down the food.*

*With some effort, he manages to get the food down.*

Kai: "*Huff huff*"

Kai: "Thanks. . .I needed that."

Kai: "I don't feel so good. . .I think I should go home and rest."

Emi: "I'm so sorry. I hope you feel better soon. . ."

Kai: "Thanks for the help Emi. I'll see you later."

*I watch Kai stagger out of the cafe, the door chime tinkling as he leaves, my heart heavy with guilt.*

Emi: "(I knew I should've chosen the macarons!)"

Emi: "(Next time, I'll make sure to ask about dietary preferences instead of assuming.)"

Emi: "(I hope the tart doesn't affect him the whole day. . .)"

Emi: "(Let's get onto the next chore. . .)"
