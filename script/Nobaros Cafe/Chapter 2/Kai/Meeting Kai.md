Emi: Let's sweep the foyer!

*I grab the broom leaning against the corner and head out to the floor, collecting the day's accumulation of dust and dirt*

*Starting at each table, I create small piles, nudging them towards a corner where a larger pile awaits.*

*As I sweep under the final table, a glint of light catches my eye. Intrigued, I crouch down and inspect the dust pile more closely.*

*To my surprise, I find a small golden charm in the shape of a camellia flower.*

*The charm is intricately detailed, with delicately sculpted petals that seem as though they could be damaged by the lightest touch. Etched on the back of the flower is the number eight.*

Emi: "What a pretty charm! I wonder where it came from. . . maybe someone's necklace or something?"

*Deciding to keep the charm in case the owner returns, I tuck it into a small apron pocket and continue sweeping the foyer.*

*After collecting the dust into a dustpan and disposing of it in a nearby trashcan, I feel a sense of accomplishment.*

*Setting the broom aside momentarily, I head to the counter to wash my hands.*

*Just as I'm about to finish up, the front door bursts open and a blaring voice shatters my eardrums.*

???: "INGRAM!! ARE YOU IN HERE?!"

*I shoot my eyes towards the cafe entrance.*

*A guy around my age stands right at the doorway, panting heavily as if he had been sprinting just before arriving, his jacket barely clinging to his shoulders.* 

*Out of the corner of my eye, I see Ingram in the middle of filling the display case, still unaware that the front door had swung right open.* 

*In his stead, I quickly pat my hands dry with a nearby towel and approach the disheveled guy to see what the ruckus is.*

Emi: "Sorry, Ingram is busy at the moment. Can I help you with something?"

*The guy looks at me desperately and claps his hands together, as if he's about to pray.*

???: "Oh thank god you're here! I lost something and I think it might be somewhere around here."

Emi: "What did you lose? Maybe I can help you find it."

???: "It's a small golden trinket thingy. It should look like a flower of some kind."

Emi: "Wait a minute, could you be talking about this?"

*I dig into my apron pocket and fish out the golden camellia charm I found earlier. As I lay it in my palm and show it to him, his eyes light up, and he nods excitedly.*

???: "That's the one! Thanks a bunch!"

*I offer the charm to him, which he graciously receives with both hands.*

???: "By the way, you're new around here aren't you? I don't think I've ever seen someone other than Ingram working here."

???: "Actually scratch that, I don't think I've ever seen Ingram working with *anybody*, period. . ." 

???: "But never mind that! Let me introduce myself. My name's Kai, what's yours?"

Emi: "Oh, right, I'm Emi! I'm helping Ingram out with both the cafe and with spirit guiding."

Kai: "Wait, *Emi*? I think I know you! Ingram was mentioning that we'd be getting a new roommate at Yuugen House!"

Emi: "I guess news spreads fast around here, huh?"

Kai: "Oh, it's nothing like that. Ingram just decided to gather everyone and tell us all at once. I was beginning to wonder when I'd get to meet you!"

Emi: "(Huh, I didn't expect anybody to be so excited about a new roommate.)"

Emi: "(What's with him? It's not like I'm some fairy goddess that descended or something. . .)"

Emi: "(That being said, I wonder what a guy like him is doing with a camellia charm in the first place.)"

Emi: "(It doesn't really fit his. . . style?)"

Emi: "By the way, how did you lose the charm? Was it from a piece of jewelry or something?"

Kai:  "Oh right, let me show you!"

*Kai rolls up his left sleeve, revealing a jade bracelet wrapped around his slender wrist.*

*He shifts his hand, revealing a small section of gold that connects one end of the bracelet to the other. With a brief motion, he reattaches the camellia charm, making a distinct clink while doing so.*

Kai: "The charm is a part of this bracelet! It's been with me ever since I came here. I don't really know why, but I feel weirdly empty taking it off so I just keep it on me at all times." 

Kai: "See this engraving on the back? The number eight is associated with good fortune, so I see it as a lucky token of some sorts! When I found out the charm went missing, I really panicked."

Kai: "I guess I really lucked out, since it's easy to miss such a small charm. I'm glad it was safe in your hands of all places. Otherwise, I wouldn't know what to do if it was gone for good."

*Kai flashes a wide grin at me, which I warmly reciprocate. Seeing him so cheerful after getting the charm back makes me feel happy for him.*

*The bracelet must mean a lot to him.*

Emi: "(His energy is contagious. . . my mood's improving just from talking to him.)"

Kai: "So I'm curious. How are you faring so far? Have you managed to regain any memories yet?" 

Kai: "How about the spirit guiding stuff? Did you-"

*Kai begins barraging me with questions, getting closer as he asks each one. He's talking at lightning speed, making it hard to comprehend what he's trying to ask.*

*Before I manage to respond, a low, rumbling sound cuts Kai's questions off.*

*The two of us stare at each other in silence, confused.*

Emi: ". . ."

Kai: ". . ."

Emi: ". . .Was that you?"

Kai: "No way, I don't know what you're talking about. That's gotta be you."

Emi: "But I just ate lunch a few hours ago! I think I'd know if it was my own stomach."

*Just then, another growl rumbles. This time, it's clearly coming from Kai.*

Kai: ". . ."

Kai: "Do. Not. Say. A. Thing."

Emi: ". . . I-"

Kai: "AHHHHHHHHH!!"

*I barely open my mouth before Kai waves his hands frantically, trying to stop me from talking. I could see his entire face turning beet red, spreading from his cheeks to the tips of his ears.*

Kai: "Okay okay, you've got me."

Kai: "So I may or may not have skipped lunch 'cause I was looking for my charm all afternoon. . ."

Emi: "You haven't eaten yet?!"

*Kai shakes his head, his hand pitifully cradling his gurgling stomach.*

Emi: "(I feel bad for him. . . he almost looks like a sad puppy.)"

Emi: "Okay, hold on, I have an idea. I can go find something for you to eat from behind the counter."

Kai: "Wait wait, stealing food is a crime! There's no need for you to go to such lengths for me."

Emi: "What? No, you've got it all wrong, I'm not gonna steal from the display case."

Emi: "Sometimes, we have stuff that doesn't turn out well and can't be sold to customers."

Emi: "(I don't have the heart to tell him that half of the ugly desserts were made by me, as a result of Ingram's pastry making sessions.)" 

Emi: "(But he doesn't have to know that.)"

Kai: "Ohhh, that makes sense. If that's the case, then I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands!"

Emi: "Okay, just wait here then. I'll have a look at what we have."

*I return to the counter and check the cooler where the off-display items are kept. Inside, I find a selection of desserts â€” pink macarons and a strawberry tart catch my eye.*

Emi: "(Hmm, I should take. . .)"
# Macarons
*I take the macarons and carefully place them in a small bag, making sure it's sealed shut. With the bag in hand, I make my way back to the cafe entrance.*

Emi: "(Huh? Where'd he go? I thought I told him to wait here.)"

*I scan the cafe, searching for any sign of Kai.*

*Suddenly, a pair of hands slam down on my shoulders, causing me to gasp and drop the macarons.*

*Kai bursts into laughter, clearly amused by his prank.*

Kai: "Gotcha, Emi! Sorry, I couldn't resist."

*Turning to face him, I try to hide my surprise with a glare.*

Emi: "Kai, you scared me!"

Kai: "Aw, come on, it was just a little joke. Here, let me make it up to you."

*He wipes a tear from his eye. After composing himself, he picks up the bag of macarons and hands them to me with a sheepish smile.*

Emi: "It isn't very nice to scare someone who went through the trouble of finding food for you."

Kai: "You're right. I promise I'll behave."

Kai: "So what did you end up finding?"

*With a huff, I push the bag of macarons into his arms.*

Emi: "There were some leftover macarons. It probably won't fill you up too much but it was what we had."

*Kai tugs at the bag, peering inside to inspect the macarons. His eyes shine brightly at the sight of them.*

Kai: "Oh sweet! I'll never turn these down, they're my favourite! I've been craving them these days too."

Emi: "I'm glad to hear that you have something nice to eat. Just remember that macarons aren't a good substitute for a meal, so you should eat a proper meal when you can."

Kai: "Don't worry, I'll make sure to eat a big meal when I get home later." 

*Kai laughs as he grabs one of the macarons and take a bite, dancing in excitement. I laugh along with him at how happy he is over a small treat.*

*He eagerly gobbles down, delighting in each bite with animated reactions.*

*In a matter of minutes, he empties the bag and looks almost sad that there aren't any more.*

Kai: "Ahh, that felt so good!"

Kai: "Thanks a lot Emi, that really hit the spot."

Emi: "Wow, you really devoured that bag. I'm surprised you didn't choke on a crumb or something!"

*Kai laughs heartily, a proud glint in his eyes.*

Kai: "What can I say? I like sweets. If you put some in front of me, I guarantee they'll disappear right under your nose."

Emi: "(I guess that's one thing we have in common.)"

Kai: "Alright, now that I've gotten a bite to eat, I'm gonna head out now."

Kai: "It was nice finally meeting you, I'll see you later Emi!"

*Kai excitedly waves as he leaves the cafe, the door chime tinkling behind his departure.*

Emi: "(What a character! I wonder where he gets his energy from.)"

Emi: "(I feel all pumped up now. Let's get onto the next chore!)"

# Strawberry tart
*I carefully place the strawberry tart into a mini box, ensuring it's secure before sealing it shut with tape. With the box in hand, I head back to the cafe entrance.*

Emi: "(Huh? Where'd he go? I thought I told him to wait here.)"

*I scan the cafe, searching for any sign of Kai.*

*Suddenly, a pair of hands slam down on my shoulders, causing me to gasp and almost drop the box. Kai bursts into laughter, clearly amused by his prank.*

Kai: "Gotcha, Emi! Sorry, I couldn't resist."

*Turning to face him, I try to hide my surprise with a glare.*

Emi: "Kai, you scared me!"

Kai: "Aw, come on, it was just a little joke. Here, let me make it up to you."

*He wipes a tear from his eye, looking at me with a sheepish smile.*

Emi: "It isn't very nice to scare someone who went through the trouble of finding food for you."

Kai: "You're right, I'm sorry. I promise I'll behave."

Kai: "So what did you end up finding?"

*With a huff, I push the box containing the strawberry tart into his arms.*

Emi: "There was a leftover strawberry tart. It probably won't fill you up too much but it was what we had."

*Kai carefully opens the box, peering inside to inspect the strawberry tart. For a brief moment, his face contorts, but he quickly covers it with a polite smile.*

Kai: "Oh, thanks! I, uh, appreciate that you took the time and effort to find something for me."

Emi: "Is something wrong? You don't look very happy."

*Kai averts his gaze, unable to look me in the eye. He hesitates to answer.*

Kai: "The truth is, I'm not a very big fan of strawberries. They just don't sit well with me."

Emi: "Oh shoot, I'm so sorry! I should've asked you if you had any preferences. I can go grab you something else!"

Kai: "No, don't worry about it! I can still eat it. I'll just make sure to eat a big meal when I get home later."

Emi: "Are you sure? You don't have to force yourself."

Kai: "Really, it's okay. Don't feel too bad, you didn't know any better."

*Despite my insistence, Kai refuses to accept anything else and makes do with the strawberry tart.*

*To prove his point, he take the tart and bites out of it.*

Emi: "W-wait, you don't have to-!"

*He forces a smile and shows me a thumbs up, signaling that he's okay. But the expression on his face says otherwise.*

Kai: "Alright, I'm gonna head out now. Thanks so much for the help! It was nice to finally meet you, I'll see you later."

Kai: ". . .mmph!"

Emi: "(!!!)"

Emi: "(Oh no! It's stuck in his chest!)"

*Panicked, I quickly run to the counter, filling a glass with water to help Kai wash down the food.*

*With some effort, he manages to get the food down.*

Kai: "*Huff huff*"

Kai: "Thanks. . .I needed that."

Kai: "I don't feel so good. . .I think I should go home and rest."

Emi: "I'm so sorry. I hope you feel better soon. . ."

Kai: "Thanks for the help Emi. I'll see you later."

*I watch Kai stagger out of the cafe, the door chime tinkling as he leaves, my heart heavy with guilt.*

Emi: "(Dang it, I should've chosen the macarons!)"

Emi: "(Next time, I'll make sure to ask about dietary preferences instead of assuming.)"

Emi: "(Anyways, now that's over with, let's get onto the next chore.)"
