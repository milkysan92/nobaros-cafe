# Meeting others
Emi: "Actually, speaking of which, I ended up meeting the other roommates while going around the cafe."

Ingram: "Ah, so you did end up seeing them after all. How did your introductions go?"

Emi: "Well, earlier, I helped Kai find a charm that fell off his bracelet. And I also gave him one of the desserts that were taken off-display."

Ingram: "Let me guess, he was so focused on searching for his charm that he ended up skipping lunch."

Emi: "That's right! How did you know?"

Ingram: "That's just Kai being Kai. He wears his heart on his sleeve, so it's easy to tell how he'll act in certain situations."

Ingram: "Based on your experience with him, I'm guessing you can relate."

Emi: "Absolutely. He was so energetic, like a human lightning bolt!"

Ingram: "Yeah, I don't know where he gets it from. I wish he channeled that energy into something other than his crazy ideas, but he's a good guy at heart."

Ingram: "You can't stay mad at him for long."

Emi: "That's true. . ."

Emi: "I also chatted with Akira briefly. I forgot to mention it to you earlier, but I actually ran into him at Yuugen House before. It was after our spirit guiding session from last time."

Emi: "We didn't talk very much, but somehow he recognized me."

Ingram: "Ah, Akira. I can always count on him, especially when it comes to keeping Kai in line. He's quite capable, so there's no need to worry too much about him."

Ingram: "He's been around the longest out of everyone, so he knows this place like the back of his hand."

Ingram: "If you need advice or a different perspective, he's a good person to ask."

Ingram: "That includes insight into recovering your memories."

Emi: "That's fair. When I was talking with him, he seemed super insightful, as if there's a lot going on inside his head."

Ingram: "He's definitely nowhere as expressive as Kai, but you can be sure that there's always brewing something inside that head of his."

Ingram: "He also doesn't beat around the bush, so he's refreshing to talk to."

Emi: "I agree, I also feel the same way."

Emi: "Ah, and when I went to the library, I came across Annelise while she was in the middle of reading."

Emi: "She's a lot more soft-spoken than Kai, but she's super sweet."

Emi: "It took some time for her to warm up to me, but once we got on the topic of books, she suddenly got a lot more talkative!"

Ingram: "That's Annelise for you. When she first came to Nobaros, she holed herself up in her room and didn't want to talk to anybody."

Ingram: "But I managed to get her to open up a little bit when I gave her some novel recommendations a while back. Since then, I've never seen her without a book in her hands."

Ingram: "If you get a chance to interact with her more, I'm sure she'd appreciate having more book buddies to talk to."

Emi: "Oh for sure! She recommended her favourite book to me, so I plan on reading it later."

*Ingram's eyes crinkle, and a delightful hum resonates in his voice. He seems pleased to hear about my interactions with the others.*

Ingram: "It seems like you had a good time meeting everyone."

Emi: "Yes, they're super nice and friendly!"

Emi: "I just wish I had more time to get to know them."

Ingram: "Don't worry, there's no rush. They'll be at Yuugen House once we wrap things up here."

Ingram: "You'll get to talk to them all you'd like then."

*I let out an exasperated sigh, feeling a bit impatient.*

*It feels good to see how much I've accomplished since the start of the day, but I can't wait to head home and get to know everybody better.*

Emi: "(Shouldn't time pass by faster if I'm busy?)"

Emi: "(I guess it is what it is. . .)"
