# Report to Ingram
Emi: "Oh, I think I finished everything!"

Emi: "Let's report back to Ingram and see how he's doing."

*After checking that all the tools were back in place, I exit the storage room.*

*Heading back to the counter, I spot Ingram looking over the cafe, lost in thought.*

Emi: "(That's rare, I would've thought he would be in the middle of preparing drinks or something.)"

Emi: "(I guess it is getting late, so there isn't as much traffic as before.)"

Emi: "Ingram, I'm back!"

*My voice seems to break his trance, and he glances over at me.*

Ingram: "Welcome back. I take it that everything went smoothly?"

Emi: "Yep! I managed to finish everything without a hitch."

Ingram: "That's good to hear, thanks for handling it."

Emi: "How was everything on your end? Were there any more rushes like earlier?"

Ingram: "It was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary, which I'd consider to be a good thing."

*Ingram looks back at the floor, a satisfied look on his face.*

Emi: "(Now that I think about it, why isn't there anybody else working here?)"

Emi: "(Managing this entire place alone must be a huge weight on Ingram's shoulders. So why doesn't he get more people to divide up the work?)"

Emi: "(I'm kind of curious, should I ask him?)"

Emi: "(Oh, but I should also tell him about how I ran into Kai, Akira and Annelise earlier. )"

Emi: "(What should I tell him. . .?)"
