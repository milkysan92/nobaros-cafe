Emi: "Oh, I think I finished everything!"

Emi: "Let's report back to Ingram and see how he's doing."

*After checking that all the tools were back in place, I exit the storage room.*

*Heading back to the counter, I spot Ingram looking over the cafe, lost in thought.*

Emi: "(That's rare, I would've thought he would be in the middle of preparing drinks or something.)"

Emi: "(I guess it is getting late, so there isn't as much traffic as before.)"

Emi: "Ingram, I'm back!"

*My voice seems to break his trance, and he glances over at me.*

Ingram: "Welcome back. I take it that everything went smoothly?"

Emi: "Yep! I managed to finish everything without a hitch."

Ingram: "That's good to hear, thanks for handling it."

Emi: "How was everything on your end? Were there any more rushes like earlier?"

Ingram: "It was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary, which I'd consider to be a good thing."

*Ingram looks back at the floor, a satisfied look on his face.*

Emi: "(Now that I think about it, why isn't there anybody else working here?)"

Emi: "(Managing this entire place alone must be a huge weight on Ingram's shoulders. So why doesn't he get more people to divide up the work?)"

Emi: "(I'm kind of curious, should I ask? Or is there some hidden reason that I shouldn't poke my head into?)"

# Let's ask Ingram

Emi: "Ingram, is there nobody else working here?"

Ingram: "Hm? Yes, that's right. It's just me."

Emi: "Don't you ever get tired or burned out from managing everything?"

Emi: "I know you said it comes down to finding the right rhythm or being organized. . . but at some point, there's got to be a limit, no?"

*Ingram shakes his head, turning around to face me as he leans against the counter.*

Ingram: "It's one of the perks of being a spirit guide."

Ingram: "As someone whose responsibility is to help people find their last joy in life on a regular basis, I need to be able to keep up with my duties."

Ingram: "As a result, my constitution is a bit different than yours."

Emi: "Does that mean you never get tired then?"

Ingram: "I still do, but it takes a lot more to get me to that state."

*Despite what Ingram tells me, I still find it hard to believe his words.*

Ingram: "Things are fine as is."
# Let's leave it alone
*A gut feeling tells me to leave the thought alone.*

Emi: "I managed to meet Kai, Annelise and Akira while I was going around!"
