# Report to Ingram
Emi: "Oh, I think I finished everything!"

Emi: "Let's report back to Ingram and see how he's doing."

*After checking that all the tools were back in place, I exit the storage room.*

*The cafe is bathed in a soft, golden glow, casting long shadows that dance across the floor. With only a few lingering customers left, an intimate sense of tranquility envelops the space.*

*As I return to the counter, I notice Ingram standing there with a cloth in hand. Although he appears to be looking at the customers, his gaze is distant, as though he's staring at something far beyond the cafe walls.*

Emi: "(That's rare, I thought he would've been in the middle of preparing drinks.)"
 
Emi: "(But I guess it is getting late. Thankfully, there isn't as many people now, compared to this morning.)"

Emi: "Ingram, I'm back!"

*My voice breaks his trance, drawing his previously distant eyes to focus on me. His expression shifts, a small smile playing on his lips as he turns to face my direction.*

Ingram: "Welcome back. I take it that everything went smoothly?"

Emi: "Yep! I managed to finish everything without a hitch."

Ingram: "That's good to hear, thanks for handling it."

Emi: "How was everything on your end? Were there any more rushes like earlier?"

Ingram: "It was alright. Nothing out of the ordinary, which I'd consider to be a good thing."

*Ingram looks back at the floor, a satisfied look on his face.*

Emi: "(Now that I think about it, why isn't there anybody else working here?)"

Emi: "(Managing this entire place alone must be a huge weight on Ingram's shoulders.)"

Emi: "(So why doesn't he get more people to divide up the work?)"

Emi: "(. . .I'm kind of curious.)"

Emi: "(Should I ask him?)"

Emi: "(Oh, but I should also let him know about how I ran into Kai, Akira and Annelise earlier. )"
