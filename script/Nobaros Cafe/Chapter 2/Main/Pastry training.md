# Pastry training
*Morning light filters through the window, gently waking me. I slowly open my eyes, the remnants of the dream still lingering in my mind.*

Emi: "(That dream. . .)"

Emi: "(So I was a class rep and a part of the student council, huh?)"

Emi: "(That person near the end. . .Who were they? Why can't I remember their face?)"

*I lie there aimlessly, trying to search the recesses of my mind for an answer, but the deeper I try to think, the emptier my head feels.*

*I stare at the ceiling, my eyes tracing the faint patterns of light and shadow, my consciousness drifting between fantasy and reality.*

Emi: "(I can't remember anything else. . . It feels like it's just on the tip of my tongue.)"

Emi: "(Ah, whatever. Let's just get up. I've got the whole day ahead of me.)"

*With a deep breath, I force my eyes open and swing my legs over the side of the bed, ready to start the day.*

Emi: "( Hmm, what should I have for breakfast?)"

Emi: "(. . . Hm? Something smells good. Is it coming from the kitchen?)"

*Peering into the kitchen, I see Ingram munching on a piece of toast while preparing some hand-dripped coffee.*

Emi: "Oh, Ingram! Good morning. I was wondering what that nice smell was."

*He looks up, greeting me with a slight smile.*

Ingram: "Good morning to you too.  Did you sleep well?"

Emi: "Yeah, my bed felt extra comfy today. I almost didn't want to get up."

Emi: "Also, something exciting happened last night! I think I recovered some of my memories."

Ingram: "Oh, that's good news. What did you recall?"

Emi: "Well, I learned that I was super involved in school. I was both a class rep and a student council member."

Ingram: "Sounds busy. Seeing how you handle yourself at the cafe, being a hard worker seems to be in your nature."

Emi: "Yeah, I like making people smile. That part hasn't changed between the past and now."

*Ingram takes his coffee over to the dinner table, and I take his place to prepare my own breakfast.*

*Pulling out two slices of milk bread, I begin spreading some jam, making myself a nice strawberry jam sandwich.*

*With my plate in hand, I join Ingram at the dining table. He's scribbling away on several pieces of paper spread across the table, leaning his head on a hand as he spins a pen in the other.*

*Curious, I lean over to take a look.*

Emi: “What are you up to?”

Ingram: “Just writing down some recipes. I was figuring out what we should make for today's baking session.”

Emi: “Oh yeah, that's happening later today, right? When are you thinking of starting?"

Ingram: "Maybe sometime after lunch. That way, we won't be baking while we're hungry."

Emi: "That's a good call. And what are we making?”

Ingram: "Well, that would depend on what we're aiming for in today's session."

Ingram: "If you want some baking practice, we could make macarons, fruit tarts or pound cake."

Ingram: "Those are relatively popular items, so it'd be useful if you learnt how to make them."

Ingram: "Alternatively, we could also make some almond croissants."

Emi: "Almond croissants? We don't serve those at the cafe, do we?"

Ingram: "No, we don't. Not yet anyways. I've been working on adding new items to the menu."

Ingram: "I've already thought of some potential contenders, as you can see from all these drafts in front of you. I just haven't taste tested any of them."

Ingram: "The almond croissant recipe is looking like the most promising option so far, so that's why I bring it up."

Ingram: "If you're interested, we could use today as a recipe testing session instead."

Emi: "Me? Aren't you the main one in charge of the cafe technically? Shouldn't you decide what's more important?"

Ingram: "Well, technically speaking, any of the four options would be good baking experience for you.."

Ingram: "I've already narrowed down the options, so it's up to what you want to make."

Emi: "(Hmm, he says he narrowed down the selection, but there's still a lot of options to choose from.)"

Emi: "(On one hand, getting practice might mean I'll get to help bake at the cafe sooner.)"

Emi: "(But recipe testing sounds really cool. Being a part of the menu development process sounds important in the grand scheme of things.)"

Emi: "Hmm, I think I'm leaning towards. . ."
