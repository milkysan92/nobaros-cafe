# Welcome dinner
Emi: "Ahh, finally home! Today felt like a really long day."

Ingram: "Well, we had to do some spirit guiding right after closing, after all."

Emi: "That's true. Now it's time to unwind!"

*Just as Ingram and I walk through the front door, boisterous chattering erupts from the kitchen. Curious, I make my way over to see what the ruckus is.*

*Peering through the doorframe, I spot Kai, Annelise and Akira gathered around the dining table. They're deep in conversation, staring at a colourful array of fresh ingredients laid out before them.*

Emi: "Hey guys! What's going on? What are you talking about?"

Kai: "Ah! Emi, Ingram, you're back!"

Akira: "Welcome home, you two. You came at a good time, we were just about to get started with making dinner."

Ingram: "Oh? You weren't going to wait for me to make dinner as usual?"

Kai: "Well, we wanted to switch it up a bit!"

Annelise: "S-since it's the first time we'd be eating together, we thought it'd be an opportunity to officially welcome you as our new roommate, Emi."

Emi: "Wow, really? That's so thoughtful of you guys, I'm honoured!"

Ingram: "So, what have you guys decided on for tonight's menu?"

Akira: "We were thinking of making some nikujaga, as per Annelise's recommendation."

Emi: "Oh, nikujaga sounds really good right now! I can't wait to see it."

Emi: "Do you guys need any help with anything? Maybe I can help wash the ingredients or something?"

Kai: "No, no, we've got it covered. You just sit back and relax!"

Emi: "Huh? Are you sure? But. . ."

Annelise: "It's okay, Emi. We'll do our best to make this a great celebration dinner!"

Emi: "Okay, if you insist. Let me know if you need my help in any way."

Emi: "I'll just watch you guys from the sidelines. I want to see the cooking process."

Akira: "That's fine by me. Let's get started then."

*Akira takes the vegetables to the sink and starts washing them, placing the cleaned ones in a colander.*

Kai: "Alright, Annelise, what do you wanna start with?"

Annelise: "Hmm, let's cut the potatoes. I'll handle it!"

*Once Akira finishes cleaning the vegetables, Annelise drags the colander of cleaned vegetables over to a cutting board. Scurrying over to a kitchen drawer, she starts digging around for a knife."

Annelise: "Hmm, where could it be. . ."

Kai: "Annelise, are you looking for a knife? I've got one right he-"

Annelise: "Ah, there it is!"

Kai: "E-Eh?! Where'd you find that?!"

*Just as Kai is about to offer a knife to her, Annelise finds a big cleaver at the back of the drawer. With an awkwardly threatening grip, she begins to hack away at the potatoes, chopping them into uneven chunks with questionable technique.*

Kai: "A-Annelise, do you need some help with that?"

Annelise: "What? I'm doing fine! See?"

*Annelise smiles as she swings the cleaver at another potato, sending a piece flying towards Kai at lightning speed.*

Kai: "OW!"

Annelise: "Oh my gosh! I'm so sorry, Kai, are you okay?"

Kai: "Yeah, I think I'm okay. . ."

Annelise: "Is your forehead okay? Can I check?"

*Kai removes his hand from his forehead, revealing a big red mark in the shape of the potato piece.*

Kai: "How does it look?"

Annelise: ". . ."

Ingram: ". . ."

Emi: ". . ."

Akira: ". . ."

Kai: "What? Why's everyone so quiet?"

Ingram: ". . .It's nothing. Your forehead is fine."

*Ingram places a hand on Kai's shoulder, earning a confused look from him. The rest of us avert our eyes from Kai, trying not to bring attention to the newly established birthmark on his head.*

Akira: "Annelise, how about you let Kai handle the chopping? You can help with stirring later on."

Annelise: ". . .Understood."

Emi: "(I've never seen someone cut potatoes in such a menacing way. . .)"

*Akira approaches Annelise, and she gives him the chef's cleaver with a pout. As Kai gets started on cutting the vegetables, Akira heads over to the sink and starts washing the dishes.*

Ingram: "Do you need any help, Akira? My hands are free."

Akira: "No, I think I'm good, but thanks. This is my way of contributing. I'd rather clean than add to the chaos back there."

Ingram: "Alright, I'll leave you to it. Seems like you've got things under control here."

Ingram: "Emi, why don't you relax while you wait for them to finish cooking? I think they have things "

Emi: "Okay, sounds good. I think I'll stay down here a little longer. Have a good shower!" 

*Ingram nods and promptly leaves the kitchen. Annelise is now washing the rice while Kai is saut√©ing on the stovetop. The savoury aroma of onions fills the air, making my stomach rumble in response.*

Akira: "Here's the rest of the ingredients, Kai. I've already measured everything for you, so just need to add everything in once the beef and vegetables are cooked."

Kai: "Got it! Thanks, Akira."

Akira: "And Annelise? How's the rice going?"

Annelise: "Everything's looking good here too! I just started the rice cooker."

Akira: "Great, thanks, Annelise. Could you help me set up the table then?"

Annelise: "Okay! I'll go grab the cutlery."

Emi: "(Huh, they work pretty well together. Have they cooked together before?)"
 
Emi: "(But judging from Annelise's knife skills, that doesn't seem like the case. I guess it does help that Akira is delegating tasks to keep things organized.)"

Emi: "(Still, I didn't expect that they'd pull something like this for me. I didn't know what to expect from them as my roommates, but I'm happy to see that they're good people.)"

*Watching the three of them work together fills me with a sense of belonging. Despite the initial chaos, they eventually find their rhythm, each person contributing in their own way. Soon enough, the cooking process wraps up without any further mishaps.*

Kai: "Tadah! Presenting the much-anticipated nikujaga!"

*A large dish sits proudly on the dining table, containing tender slices of beef intermingled with potatoes, carrots, and onions, all simmered to perfection in a savory broth. The glossy sheen on the surface hints at the dish's deliciously hearty nature, making my mouth water with anticipation.*

Emi: "Wow, it looks so legit! I can't believe you guys made this, considering all that happened in the kitchen!"

Akira: "Glad to hear. Let's have a taste and hope it's as good as it looks."

Emi: "Thank you for the meal!"

*With my chopsticks, I eagerly dig into the nikujaga with a generous bite. Rich, savoury umami explodes in my mouth, sending goosebumps down my arms. The tender beef, perfectly cooked potatoes, and carrots melt together into a harmonious blend of tastes that dance on my tastebuds.*

Emi: "Mmm, that's delicious! I feel like I'm ascending. . ."

Annelise: "Thank goodness, I'm glad you like it."

Ingram: "Yeah, this gets my seal of approval. Good job, you guys."

Kai: "Whoa, a compliment from Ingram?! Darn, I'd do this all over in a heartbeat to hear that again!"

Ingram: "Ah, is that so? Then can I take that to mean you'll take over cooking duty from now on?"

Kai: "Wait, wait, that's not what I meant! I-"

Ingram: "What's that? You'd love to? Sounds good, I'll be counting on you to make tomorrow's breakfast then."

Kai: "Listen to me!"

*I watch as Ingram and Kai continue to banter. It's a bit jarring to see Ingram teasing Kai like this, considering his usual calm demeanor. Akira notices me staring and gestures closer to me, speaking in a quiet tone so as to not draw any attention.*

Akira: "Surprised?"

Emi: "H-huh? Is it that easy to tell?"

Akira: "Haha, it's written all over your face. You're very transparent about your emotions you know?"

Akira: "I don't know what it is with those two, but they're always like this whenever we're gathered together."

Akira: "Just take it as a regular occurrence. You'll get used to it eventually."

*I nod, taking in his words. Despite the unexpected turn of events, the dinner table is filled with a homey, lively atmosphere. With a contented sigh, I savour the rest of the dinner as the evening wears on.*
