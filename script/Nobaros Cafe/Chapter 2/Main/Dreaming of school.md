# Dreaming of school
Emi: "(Finally, my sweet bed!)"

*I collapse onto the plush covers of my bed, feeling fatigue creeps into my limbs. Having been untouched the entire day, the bed is at the perfect temperature, enveloping me in a cool, soothing embrace.*

*As I slip under the blanket, I gaze at the soft moonlight filtering through the window, casting a gentle glow that almost lulls me to sleep.*

Emi: "(It's strange to think that this room used to feel so foreign, but now, it's becoming pretty comfy.)"

Emi: "(I wonder why this place feels so welcoming. Is it because of the peaceful atmosphere? Or is it because of the people staying here. . .?)"

*A tender, happy feeling spreads through my chest as I picture everyone's faces.*

Emi: "(I could get used to this.)"

Emi: "(But I can't stay here forever. . . Someday, I'll recover all my memories and I'll have to leave.)"

*I ponder over the customers I've helped so far, recalling all the memories I've encountered during spirit guiding.*

*The uncertainty of whether I'm currently alive or not weighs on me, and an anxious feeling residing at the back of my mind resurfaces.*

Emi: "(Why am I here? What was my life like?)"

Emi: "(Was I in an accident, or did I do this to myself. . .?)"

*Difficult questions swirl around in my mind, but they remain unresolved, leaving me feeling more anxious by the second.*

*I shake my head, cutting off my train of thought.*

Emi: "(I'm going to be up all night if I keep thinking about this.)"

Emi: "(It's been a long day. I should get some rest.)"

*I close my eyes and turn to the side, clutching the blanket as I find a comfortable position.*

*Taking deep breaths, my body warmth mingles with the bed covers, wrapping my body in a cocoon of comfort that eventually pulls me into a deep slumber.*

UK_generic: "Okay, gather around everyone!"

UK_generic: "Hey, you there! Can you move over a bit? I can't see that guy behind you."

UK_generic: "Alright, hold that pose! Say cheese in 3. . ."

UK_generic: "2. . ."

Uk_generic: "1. . ."

UK_generic: "Cheese!"

*A group of excited students gather around, sporting what seems to be volleyball uniforms.*

*Behind them is a staircase leading to the main entrance of a school building, framed by several pink petals fluttering from the cherry blossom trees around.*

Dream Emi: "Okay, looks good! Thanks everyone, this is going to go right in the yearbook!"

*I glance down at the camera in my hands, taking in the group photo displayed on the screen. Unlike the sports team in front of me, I'm wearing a school uniform.* 

Emi: "(This scene feels familiar. . . Is this another memory of mine?)"

Manager: "Thanks for coming out to take our photo, Emi!"

Manager: "I'm sure it isn't easy to find time in your schedule when you're so busy with the school committee stuff."

Dream Emi: "Oh, it's alright! I'm always happy to lend a hand."

Dream Emi: "Staying busy just means I can help more people."

Manager: "You're so trustworthy. We can always count on you!"

Emi: "(That's right, I remember. . .I was so involved in middle school. I barely had time for myself.)"

Emi: "(But despite all that, I was happy whenever someone complimented me. It was worth seeing their smiles.)"

Emi: "(After all, I wanted to be loved. . .)"

*The scene shifts. I'm now in an empty classroom, holding a stapler in one hand and a stack of paper handouts in the other. The sunset pierces through the window, casting a golden, nostalgic atmosphere across the room.*

*I staple the handouts, the repetitive crunching of paper under the stapler feeling almost hypnotic.*

*The pile in front of me slowly decreases as I work, and I find a comfortable rhythm.*

*Suddenly,. I hear faint laughter coming from outside, and I glance down from the window. There's a group of friends leaving the school gates, immersed in cheerful conversation.*

*A pang of loneliness hits me, my clutch on the stapler tightening slightly.*

Emi: "(This feeling. . .)"

Emi: "(I volunteered to become the class rep one day, in an attempt to put myself out there and get to know my classmates.)"

Emi: "(Gradually, they started taking notice of me and I got to know everyone's names.)"

Emi: "(But sometimes. . . it felt so lonely.)"

*As I'm lost in thought, the classroom door swings open. A figure steps in, but their face is hazy. Even after squinting, I'm unable to make out any of the details on them.*

*They approach me with an air of confidence and warmth, and I'm struck with an odd sense of familiarity upon seeing them.*

UK_generic: "Emi, you're still here? You've been working so hard!"

UK_generic: "You need to take a break once in a while, you know. Everyone appreciates what you do, but you shouldn't push yourself so much."

*A sense of reassurance washes over me. This person feels like a close friend.*

Dream Emi: "Yeah, I know. . . It's just that Mr. Tachibana is counting on me to get this done and I want to make sure everything's perfect."

UK_generic: "And it always is, because you put so much care into it!"

UK_generic: "But remember, people might take advantage of you if you don't take care of yourself."

Dream Emi: ". . .You're right."

UK_generic: "Aw, don't look so sad. I'm just worried about you, especially when you can't say no to anybody."

UK_generic: "Here, let me help bring those to the staff lounge!"

Dream Emi: "What? No, it's okay, you don't have to-!"

Uk_generic: "Oh relax, I've been waiting for you this whole time so that we can go home together. At least this gives me something to do."

Dream Emi: ". . .Thank you."
