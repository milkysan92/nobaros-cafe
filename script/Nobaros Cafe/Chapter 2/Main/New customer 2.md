UK_generic: "Um, excuse me. . ."

*A hesitant voice breaks my train of thought, and I turn my head to find a man who appears quite disoriented.*

Emi: "Hi, how can I help you?"

UK_generic: "Do you know where I am? I think I'm a bit lost."

Emi: "(He doesn't know where he is? Could he be a customer?)"

*I glance at Ingram, who seems to have realized what I was thinking. He nods at me, confirming my suspicions, and steps forward to greet the man.*

Ingram: "Welcome to Nobaros, the realm situated between life and death."

Ingram: "My name is Ingram, I work as a barista here at Nobaros Cafe."

Ingram: "It's a pleasure to meet you. May I know how I should refer to you?"

UK_generic: "Oh uh, just Izumi is fine."

Ingram: "Well then Izumi, do you remember anything? Either about yourself or what you were doing just before this?"

Izumi: "Yes, I was in my room not that long ago. I still remember it clearly."

Izumi: "I was just about to head to bed, but then I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my chest and had trouble breathing. Within minutes, I lost my strength and passed out."

Izumi: "For a brief moment, everything felt cold and still. All the thoughts in my head completely disappeared, and I just felt absolute nothingness."

*Izumi clutches his chest, the memory of his heart attack still vivid.*

Izumi: "When I regained consciousness, I found myself here."

Emi: "(Hmm, so he does remember what happened to him. That rules out the possiblity of him being a vagabond.)"

Emi: "(So that means he's actually. . .)"

Emi: "(What a surprise, he's so young too. Is he in his twenties maybe? There's no way he's older than thirty at most.)"

Izumi: "So you said this is the realm between life and death. . .? I'm not in the afterlife just yet?"

Ingram: "No, you're here because there are unresolved matters from your life."

Ingram: "As a spirit guide, I'll be helping you through the process of fulfilling one last joy before you move on."

Ingram: "But first, would you like something to drink? It may help to calm your mind and sort your feelings out as we chat."

*Ingram presents the special drink menu to him, offering a selection of beverages to choose from.*

Ingram: "You can select any of the drinks on this menu here."

Izumi: ". . .I see. Thank you, I'll take some sencha tea please."

Ingram: "Coming right up."

*Ingram leaves to go prepare the tea, leaving the two of us alone at the counter.*

*As soon as Ingram is out of sight, Izumi turns to me with an uncertain look.*

Izumi: "So your name is. . .?"

Emi: "Ah hello, my name is Emi! I help Ingram out with the spirit guiding stuff."

Izumi: "Ah okay, nice to meet you. . ."

*Izumi's voice grows quiet, and awkward silence fills the air.*

Emi: ". . ."

Izumi: ". . ."

Emi: "S-so, what do you think of Nobaros?"

Izumi: "Eh? I guess it's nice and peaceful. . ."

Emi: "Right? I like it too!"

Izumi: "I see. . ."

Emi: ". . ."

Izumi: ". . ."

Emi: "(Ingram, I'm begging you, please come back soon. . .)"

*I carefully watch Izumi out of the corner of my eye, trying to be as discreet as possible. He appears to be studying the cafe interior, slowly soaking in all the little details.*

*His gaze lingers on the array of coffee beans stacked against the wall, seemingly deep in thought. The ambient light accentuates his features, especially the mole on his neck. Despite his towering height, he has a gentle demeanor that's far from intimidating.*

*Interestingly, he doesn't seem very shocked or angry, despite his circumstances.*

Emi: "(Hmm, I thought he'd be more distressed in this situation.)"

Emi: "(Obviously, nobody would be very happy after a heart attack, but he's strangely calm.)"

Emi: "(If it were me in his position. . .)"

*A chill runs through my spine. Shaking my head, I decide not to explore that thought.*

Emi: "(I don't want to accidentally jinx myself. I haven't recovered my memories yet.)"

Emi: "(Who knows what could've happened to me?)"

*Just then, Ingram returns with a pot of freshly brewed sencha tea, breaking Izumi out of his thoughts.*

Ingram: "Sorry for the wait, here's your sencha tea."

*Ingram places a ceramic cup on the counter, and begins to pour a cup. Hot steam emanates from the tea spout, dissipating into the air with each passing moment.*

Izumi: "Thank you, sorry for the trouble. . ."

*As Izumi sips his tea, the tension in his shoulders disappears and his body deflates with a satisfied look.*

*After a moment of relaxation, Ingram starts explaining the spirit guiding process as Izumi listens attentively, nodding every so often.*

Emi: "(. . .He hasn't questioned anything Ingram said so far. This guy really is handling himself well.)"

*Just as Ingram finishes his explanation, Izumi notices my gaze and turns to me.*

Izumi: "Um sorry, is there something on my face?"

Izumi: "It's just that you're staring at me so intently. . ."

Emi: "Oh no, sorry! I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."

Izumi: "It's alright, I was just a little anxious whether my glasses were offset or something."

Emi: "Don't worry, it's nothing like that. I'm impressed by how well you're taking Ingram's explanation."

Emi: "It's quite a lot of new information to take in, especially after you just learn about your. . .erm. . ."

Izumi: "It's okay. There's no need to beat around the bush, I'm well aware of what happened."

Ingram: "Emi is right. All sorts of people come through these parts. Some take more time for the reality to set in."

Ingram: "But from what I can see, it almost seems like you've accepted what happened already, is that right?"

Izumi: "Ah, well. . ."

*Izumi averts his gaze, his eyes falling on the trail of steam rising lazily from his cup. His silence stretches, the air thick with unspoken words and unresolved emotions.*

*Finally, he speaks, his voice soft and tinged with a hint of melancholy.*

Izumi: "Would you care to listen to my story?"

Ingram: "Of course, go ahead. Whatever you're comfortable telling us."

Ingram: "It would help us understand you and your life better."

Izumi: ". . .I have what's called cardiomyopathy. It's a condition that makes it harder for my heart to pump blood."

Izumi: "Because of my condition, I've dealt with heart complications all my life."

Izumi: "Although I used to live in the city as a kid, my parents decided to move to the countryside when I entered middle school."

Izumi: "They thought a more peaceful lifestyle might've been better for me."

Izumi: "But as a kid, there was nothing more boring than being surrounded by nothing to do."

*Izumi chuckles, his laughter carrying a hint of nostalgia as he reminisces his youth.*

Izumi: "I started picking up photography to pass the time. At first, it was just borrowing my dad's camera to take pictures of the cicadas during the summer."

Izumi: "But over time, the hobby grew on me. That's how I became a photographer."

Emi: "Oh wow, that's amazing! Did you ever publish your photos at an exhibition of some sorts?"

Izumi: "Yes, my photos were often posted on a blog that was managed by my older sister."

Izumi: "I was hesitant at first, but after some encouragement from my sister, I decided to let her post my photos."

Izumi: "The blog ended up attracting a lot of attention, and people left really nice comments about how much they liked my photos. So after that, I continued to snap photos for her to post."

Izumi: "In fact, some of my favourite memories are from photography trips my sister organized. She'd find out about a scenic location from social media, then drag me there to sightsee and take photos."

Izumi: "When I told her I wanted to go professional, she bought me a brand new camera for my birthday. It was the super expensive kind too."

Izumi: "She was always supportive of me. Even after she moved out and got married, she kept the photography blog going."

*A warm smile carves itself on Izumi's lips as he reminisces about his sister.*

Izumi: "It. . .was her way of trying to create memories of me. With my heart condition, I couldn't help but get anxious about what would happen if I passed away at any given moment."

Izumi: "She was the one who showed me how to live in the present."

Izumi: "Now that I'm here, it's sort of a funny feeling. I do miss her, but more than that, I'm really glad that I was able to leave behind all of my photos at least."

Izumi: "That way, a part of me will always remain as she continues with life."

Emi: "(. . .His sister must've been proud of him to support him so wholeheartedly. He talks about her so kindly.)"

Izumi: "So. . .I guess that's why in your eyes, I'm dealing with this relatively well. A part of me has always expected this to happen to me someday."

Izumi: "There's just one thing I haven't been able to achieve as a photographer."

Izumi: "To create my magnum opus. My one true masterpiece."

Izumi: "There were definitely lots of photos that turned out beautifully, but there was something missing from all of them."

Emi: "What was missing? Was there a certain feeling or subject you were aiming for?"

*Izumi shakes his head, staring down at his lap without an answer. Judging from the melancholy in his expression, the idea of creating his magnum opus must've weighed heavily on him.*

Izumi: "Unfortunately, I'm not actually sure what that 'something' is."

Izumi: "I'm just not satisfied with the photos I've taken to date."

Izumi: "I believe that desire would be what Ingram was referring to earlier, about an unresolved matter from my life."

*Izumi meets our gaze, his eyes carrying a determined glint that speaks of both regret and hope.*

*In that moment, I realize that despite his gentle impression, there's a resilience in him, a quiet, stubborn strength to fulfill his desire.*

Izumi: "So if you guys are supposed to help me before I go, I'll take this as another chance to create the photo I've been striving for."

Ingram: ". . .I see, I admire your determination."

Ingram: "I'm sure once you find that missing puzzle piece, that desire of yours won't burden you anymore."

Ingram: "And I'd wager your sister would want you to move on freely."

Ingram: "Thank you for sharing about your life with us. We'll definitely do our best to help you."

*Ingram rises from his chair and walks over to Izumi, extending his hand.*

*Izumi smiles, accepting the gesture with a slight bow. A quiet understanding seems to form between the two, almost like an unspoken promise.*

Ingram: "Emi, can you start stacking the chairs on the tables? I don't think we'll receive any more customers, so we'll be closing up shop a bit earlier than usual."

Ingram: "We'll bring Izumi to the mirror afterwards."

Emi: "Okay, just leave it to me! I'll get it done in no time."

Izumi: ". . ."

Ingram: "Here we are. This is the Sweven Mirror, where the spirit guiding will take place."

Ingram: "Once you enter, you'll go through a dream sequence before finally being sent off to the afterlife."

Izumi: "So this is where it's all going to happen. . ."

*Izumi approaches the mirror, stopping just shy of it. For a moment, he appears to be pondering something. But before long, he takes a deep breath and turns around to face me and Ingram.*

Izumi: "Thank you for this. I really do appreciate it."

*Izumi's face lights up, his eyes shining with resolve. His expression carries determination, a reflection of the courage he's mustered to face his past.*

*As he steps towards the mirror, its surface begins to shimmer with an ethereal light, enveloping him in a gentle embrace. I watch as the light swirls around him, drawing him into its depths with a soft, almost melodic hum.*

*As Izumi disappears into the mirror, its light slowly fades, leaving behind a lingering sense of peace. With a simple gesture, Ingram indicates that it's now my turn to enter.*

Ingram: "Emi, remember that you can always consult me if you get stuck while going through his memories."

Ingram: "Just call for me, and I'll respond."

Emi: "Thanks Ingram, I think I have an idea of what I'm doing."

*Ingram smiles at my response and closes his eyes. Raising both arms, he opens his palms and mutters under his breath.*

*Within seconds, a blue luminescent aura forms itself around the both of us. A tender feeling courses through my body, bringing a sense of weightlessness.*

Emi: "(The aura feels gentler this time. Did he adjust his powers slightly to make me more comfortable?)"

*With Ingram concentrating on maintaining the aura around us, I turn to face the mirror.*

Emi: "(Let's go. I'll do everything I can to help Izumi!)"
