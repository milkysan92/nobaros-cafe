UK_generic: "Um, excuse me. . ."

*A hesitant voice breaks my train of thought, and I turn my head to find a man who appears quite disoriented.*

Emi: "Hi, how can I help you?"

UK_generic: "Do you know where I am? I think I'm a bit lost."

Emi: "(He doesn't know where he is? Could he be a customer?)"

*I glance at Ingram, who seems to have realized what I was thinking. He nods at me, confirming my suspicions, and steps forward to greet the man.*

Ingram: "Welcome to Nobaros, the realm situated between life and death."

Ingram: "My name is Ingram, I work as a barista here at Nobaros Cafe."

Ingram: "It's a pleasure to meet you. May I know how I should refer to you?"

UK_generic: "Oh uh, just Izumi is fine."

Ingram: "Well then Izumi, do you remember anything? Either about yourself or what you were doing just before this?"

Izumi: "Yes, I was in my room not that long ago. I still remember it clearly."

Izumi: "I was just about to head to bed, but then I suddenly felt a sharp pain in my chest and had trouble breathing. Within minutes, I lost my strength and passed out."

Izumi: "For a brief moment, everything felt cold and still. All the thoughts in my head completely disappeared, and I just felt absolute nothingness."

*Izumi clutches his chest, the memory of his heart attack still vivid.*

Izumi: "When I regained consciousness, I found myself here."

Emi: "(Hmm, so he does remember what happened to him. That rules out the possiblity of him being a vagabond.)"

Emi: "(So that means he's actually. . .)"

Emi: "(What a surprise, he's so young too. Is he in his twenties maybe? There's no way he's older than thirty at most.)"

Izumi: "So you said this is the realm between life and death. . .? I'm not in the afterlife just yet?"

Ingram: "No, you're here because there are unresolved matters from your life."

Ingram: "As a spirit guide, I'll be helping you through the process of fulfilling one last joy before you move on."

Ingram: "But first, would you like something to drink? It may help to calm your mind and sort your feelings out as we chat."

*Ingram presents the special drink menu to him, offering a selection of beverages to choose from.*

Ingram: "You can select any of the drinks on this menu here."

Izumi: ". . .I see. Thank you, I'll take some sencha tea please."

Ingram: "Coming right up."

*Ingram leaves to go prepare the tea, leaving the two of us alone at the counter.*

*As soon as Ingram is out of sight, Izumi turns to me with an uncertain look.*

Izumi: "So your name is. . .?"

Emi: "Ah hello, my name is Emi! I help Ingram out with the spirit guiding stuff."

Izumi: "Ah okay, nice to meet you. . ."

*Izumi's voice grows quiet, and awkward silence fills the air.*

Emi: ". . ."

Izumi: ". . ."

Emi: "S-so, what do you think of Nobaros?"

Izumi: "Eh? I guess it's nice and peaceful. . ."

Emi: "Right? I like it too!"

Izumi: "I see. . ."

Emi: ". . ."

Izumi: ". . ."

Emi: "(Ingram, I'm begging you, please come back soon. . .)"

*I carefully watch Izumi out of the corner of my eye, trying to be as discreet as possible.*

*Interestingly, he doesn't seem very shocked or angry, despite his circumstances.*

Emi: "(Hmm, I thought he'd be more distressed in this situation.)"

Emi: "(Obviously, nobody would be very happy after a heart attack, but he's strangely calm.)"

Emi: "(If it were me in his position. . .)"

*A chill runs through my spine. Shaking my head, I decide not to explore that thought.*

Emi: "(I don't want to accidentally jinx myself. I haven't recovered my memories yet.)"

Emi: "(Who knows what could've happened to me?)"

*Just then, Ingram returns with a pot of freshly brewed sencha tea.*

*As he pours a cup for Izumi, hot steam emanates from the flowing stream, dissipating into the air with each passing moment.*

*As Izumi sips his tea, the tension in his shoulders disappears and his body deflates with a satisfied look.*

*Ingram starts explaining the spirit guiding process, while Izumi listens attentively, nodding every so often.*

Emi: "(. . .He hasn't questioned anything Ingram said so far. This guy really is handling himself well.)"

*Izumi notices my gaze and turns to me.*

Izumi: "Um sorry, is there something on my face?"

Izumi: "It's just that you're staring at me so intently. . ."

Emi: "Oh no, sorry! I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable."

Emi: "I'm impressed by how well you're taking everything."

Izumi: "It's alright. No harm done."

Ingram: "All sorts of people come through these parts. Some take more time for the reality to set in."

Ingram: "But from what I can see, it almost seems like you've accepted what happened already."

Izumi: ". . ."

*Izumi averts his gaze, his eyes falling on the trail of steam rising lazily from his cup.*

Izumi: ". . .Would you care to listen to my story?"

Ingram: "Please, go right ahead. Whatever you're comfortable telling us."

Ingram: "It would help us understand you and your life experiences better."

Izumi: ". . .I have what's called cardiomyopathy. It's a condition that makes it harder for my heart to pump blood."

Izumi: "Because of my condition, I've dealt with heart complications all my life."

Izumi: "Although I used to live in the city as a kid, my parents decided to move to the countryside when I entered middle school."

Izumi: "They thought a more peaceful lifestyle might've been better for me."

Izumi: "But as a kid, there was nothing more boring than being surrounded by nothing to do."

*Izumi laughs, reminiscing his youth.*

Izumi: "I started picking up photography to pass the time. At first, it was just borrowing my dad's camera to take pictures of the cicadas during the summer."

Izumi: "But over time, the hobby grew on me. That's how I became a photographer."

Emi: "Oh wow, that's amazing! Did you ever publish your photos at an exhibition of some sorts?"

Izumi: "Yes, my photos were often posted on a blog that was managed by my older sister."

Izumi: "I was hesitant at first, but after some encouragement from my sister, I decided to let her post my photos."

Izumi: "The blog ended up attracting a lot of attention, and people left really nice comments about how much they liked my photos. So after that, I continued to snap photos for her to post."

Izumi: "In fact, some of my favourite memories are from photography trips my sister organized. She'd find out about a scenic location from social media, then drag me there to sightsee and take photos."

Izumi: "When I told her I wanted to go professional, she bought me a brand new camera for my birthday. It was the super expensive kind too."

Izumi: "She was always supportive of me. Even after she moved out and got married, she kept the photography blog going."

*A warm smile carves itself on Izumi's lips as he reminisces about his sister.*

Emi: "(Seeing him talk so passionately about photography makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.)"

Emi: "(His sister must've been proud of him to support him so wholeheartedly. He talks about her so kindly.)"

Izumi: "In spite of all that, there's just one thing I haven't been able to achieve."

Izumi: "To create my magnum opus. My one true masterpiece."

Izumi: "I definitely have photos that I'm proud of, but there was something missing from all of them."

Emi: "What was missing? Was there a certain feeling or subject you were aiming for?"

*Izumi shakes his head, staring down at his lap without an answer.*

*Judging from the melancholy in his expression, the idea of creating his magnum opus must've weighed heavily on him.*

Izumi: "Unfortunately, I'm not actually sure what that 'something' is."

Izumi: "I'm just not satisfied with the photos I've taken to date."

*Izumi looks right at me and Ingram, his eyes carrying a determined glint that speaks of both regret and hope.*

Izumi: "This must be what Ingram was referring to earlier about an unresolved matter from my life."

Izumi: "So if you guys are supposed to help me before I go. . .I'll definitely take this as another chance to create the photo I've been striving for."

Ingram: "I see, I admire your determination."

Ingram: "I'm sure once you find that missing puzzle piece, that perfectionist side of you won't burden you anymore."

Ingram: "And I'd wager your sister would want you to move on freely."

Ingram: "Thank you for sharing about your life with us. We'll definitely do our best to help you."

*Ingram rises from his chair and walks over to Izumi, extending his hand.*

*Izumi accepts the gesture with a slight bow. A quiet understanding seems to form between the two, almost like an unspoken promise.*

Ingram: "Emi, can you start stacking the chairs on the tables? I don't think we'll receive any more customers, so we'll be closing up shop a bit earlier than usual."

Ingram: "We'll bring Izumi to the mirror afterwards."

Emi: "Okay, just leave it to me! I'll get it done in no time."

Izumi: ". . ."

Ingram: "Here we are. This is the Sweven Mirror, where the spirit guiding will take place."

Ingram: "Once you enter, there's no coming back."

Izumi: "So this is where I'm going to. . ."

*Izumi approaches the mirror, stopping just shy of it. For a moment, he appears to be pondering something.*

*But before long, he takes a deep breath and turns around to face me and Ingram.*

Izumi: "Thank you for this. I really do appreciate it."

*Izumi's face lights up with determination, full of motivation and life.*

*My chest tightens slightly as I watch him enter the mirror, its light enveloping him whole. As soon as there's no more trace of him, Ingram turns towards me.*

Ingram: "Emi, remember that you can always consult me if you get stuck while going through his memories."

Ingram: "Just call for me, and I'll respond."

Emi: "Thanks Ingram, I think I have an idea of what I'm doing."

*Ingram smiles hearing my response and closes his eyes. Raising both arms, he opens his palms and mutters under his breath.*

*Within seconds, a blue luminescent aura forms itself around the both of us. A tender feeling courses through my body, bringing a sense of weightlessness.*

Emi: "(The aura feels a lot gentler this time. Did he adjust his powers slightly to make me more comfortable?)"

*With Ingram concentrating on maintaining the aura around us, I turn to face the mirror.*

Emi: "(Let's go. I'll do everything I can to help Izumi!)"
