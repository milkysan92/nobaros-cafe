# Cafe Intro
Emi: "Thank you for coming!"

*A bell chimes at the front of the store, signaling the end of the chaotic lunch hour.*

Emi: "(Phew, that's the last customer! I can finally catch my breath. . .)"

*Today had been unusually hectic. It was peaceful at first, with only a handful of regulars popping in for their morning coffee or bagel.*

*As the day progressed, more and more customers trickled in, looking for a refreshment to enjoy.*

*Before I knew it, the store had filled up in the blink of an eye.*

*For hours, I scrambled in every direction, alternating between the floor and counter, as I relayed orders to Ingram.*

Emi: "(Somehow, I made it through. . .Thank God it's over.)"

*I collapse into a chair at a nearby table, stretching my arms in an attempt to relieve the tension in my muscles.*

*Out of nowhere, a light poke taps at my shoulder.*

*I turn to see Ingram standing there, with two icy drinks in hand.*

Ingram: "Good job, you managed pretty well out there."

Ingram: "Here, I made some iced coffee."

Ingram: "I figured you might need a little treat to cool off and recharge. Go on, drink up."

*He takes the seat in front of me, passing one of the drinks my way.*

*With the glass in hand, I take a small sip, trying not to mess up my uniform.*

Emi: "(Oh? This coffee. . .)"

*My tastebuds are greeted by a delightful sweetness, a subtle hint of vanilla hidden within.*

*In an instant, my sweet tooth kicks in, tempting me to devour the whole thing.*

*Small mouthfuls quickly turn into bigger gulps.*

*Next thing I know, there's only a few ice cubes remaining at the bottom of my glass.*

Emi: "(That really hit the spot! I feel all refreshed now.)"

*I glance at Ingram, who's casually leaning against the back of his chair in a nonchalant manner. With a leg over the other, he continues to enjoy his drink.*

*His face is brimming with vitality, not a sign of exhaustion to be seen.*

Emi: "(. . .If I didn't know any better, it'd be hard to believe there was even a crowd earlier.)"

Emi: "(Does this happen regularly? How does he do it?)"

Emi: ". . .You know Ingram, you're really impressive."

Emi: "Earlier, you were pumping out drinks like no tomorrow. But right now, you look like you're in vacation mode."

Emi: "Meanwhile there's me, who could barely able to keep up with all the orders. I never even knew things could get that busy!"

Ingram: "Hmm, well, you are pretty new to this."

Ingram: "Some days are on the slower end, but there are days like today where things can get crazy."

*He straightens his back, setting down his now empty glass.*

Ingram: "It's all about finding the right rhythm and keeping things organized."

Ingram: "It's natural to feel overwhelmed at first, but I trust you'll pick things up soon. "

Ingram: "Eventually, you'll be able to breeze right through the rush hours as well."

*I gulp nervously at Ingram's words. He's probably trying to encourage me, but the pressure to do well feels kind of. . . intimidating.*

*The idea of handling so many orders at once still seems like a faraway dream. I can't imagine being on the same level as him.*

Emi: "(Maybe in a million years, I'll get there. . . surely. . .)"

*Ingram gets up from the table, collecting the two glasses as he heads back to the counter.*

*I quickly follow suit, feeling somewhat rejuvenated from the short coffee break.*

Ingram: "Well, now that we've caught our breath, it's time to tackle the next tasks on our list."

*His words catch me off guard, and I nearly choke.*

Emi: "Wait, what? There's more?"

Ingram: "Hmm? Of course, we're only halfway through the day. There's still lots to do."

*My heart sinks. The happy, nonchalant mood from earlier disappears, replaced by a looming sense of dread as I'm reminded that the day isn't quite over yet.*

*I watch as Ingram fills the coffee grinders, my limbs growing heavier by the second.*

Emi: "(There's no way around this, is there?)"

Emi: ". . .*sigh*."

Emi: "Alright then. What do we have to do?"

*He looks over at me, his smug smile unwavering. He seems almost gleeful, as if he's looking forward to putting me to work.*

Ingram: "Well, for starters, there's a little housekeeping that needs to be done." 

Ingram: "Let's see. . ."

Ingram: "Well, the foyer needs some sweeping. . . and there's empty dishes that need to be collected. Oh, and the library could use some dusting."

Emi: ". . ."

Emi: "We still have to do all of that. . .?"

Ingram: "Mmhm. There's always something to do, but don't feel too pressured."

Ingram: "You have all day to get through everything."

Ingram: "Just take it one task at a time, and it'll be over before you know it."

Emi: "Urgh. . . I guess it has to be done one way or another."

Emi: "What about you then? What are you gonna be doing?"

Ingram: "Well, someone has to be there to handle the customers, right? I'll be doing my barista duties and manning the cash register."

Ingram: "You're still learning the ropes, so I think it's best if I handle those tasks for now."

Ingram: "At least, until you're more comfortable with everything."

Emi: "Oh. . . I guess that makes sense."

Ingram: "Alright, let's get down to business then."

Ingram: "I'm going to refill some of the pastries in the display case. You can find anything you need in the back."

Emi: "Ah, yes boss!"

*As he heads over to the other side of the counter, I turn around, facing the direction of the storage room.*

Emi: "(Okay, let's do this!)" 

Emi: "(Just like he said, this will all be over before I know it!)"

*I smack my face twice in an attempt to pump myself up.*

Ingram: ". . .pfft."

*Hearing a snicker from behind, I spin around, finding myself face to face with Ingram once more.*

*His lips twitch at the corners, his entire body quivering in an attempt to stifle a laugh.*

Ingram: "Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt your. . . *moment*."

Emi: "(Oh no, it's over. . .He definitely saw everything just now. . .)"

Ingram: "Should I be worried for your sanity? Maybe you should take the rest of the day off."

*A blush creeps across my cheeks as Ingram's gaze lingers on me.*

Emi: "I'm perfectly fine, thank you! I was just trying to, um, motivate myself."

Emi: "Besides, I thought you went to go fill up the display case!"

Ingram: "I was *going* to, but I forgot to tell you something."

Ingram: "I didn't expect you to resort to such extreme measures as soon as I turned my back though. . ."

Ingram: "Maybe I should've made you two coffees earlier. That way, you wouldn't have to abuse yourself to stay motivated."

*He nearly loses his composure, but manages to keep himself together at the last second.*

*The burning sensation in my face festers, spreading up to the tips of my ears.*

Emi: "(. . .isn't he enjoying this a little too much?)"

Emi: "(I better change the subject before he says anything else. . .)"

Emi: "A-anyway! What was it that you wanted to tell me?"

Ingram: "Right, I wanted to let you know that you might meet some of the others who also live at Yuugen House."

Ingram: "They often lounge around the cafe at this time."

Ingram: "It might be a good chance for you to introduce yourself and get to know them a bit if you'd like."

Emi: "That's fair. What are their names?"

Ingram: "There's Kai, Annelise and Akira. I've mentioned your name before, so they should be aware of who you are."

Ingram: "If you haven't met any of them already, today might be your chance. I'm sure they'll be happy to meet you."

Emi: "Kai, Annelise and Akira. . . alright, I'll remember that."

Emi: "Well then, I'll get right on those chores now. Be back soon!"

Ingram: "Sounds good. I'll be right here if you need anything."

Ingram: "Just try not to resort to such. . . painful methods next time."

Emi: "Ahhh!! Stop bringing it up!"

*Ingram smirks as I try and shoo him away.*

*Once he's out of sight, I start making my way over to the back storage room.*

Emi: "Whoa, this place is surprisingly clean!"

*Rows of shelves line the walls from floor to ceiling, holding various cleaning supplies.*

*From disinfectant bottles to neatly folded cloths, they are all meticulously arranged by type, making them easy to find and grab.*

*On the opposite end of the room is a large cooler. It seems to be well-maintained, containing unopened cartons of milk, cream and other baking ingredients.*

*Running a finger along one of the shelves, I find that there's not a speck of dust to be found. The place was absolutely spotless.*

Emi: "(Everything's so neatly organized.)"

Emi: "(Did Ingram do all of this too? He really is on a different level. . .)"

*I look around, searching for the tools I need to finish my chores.*

Emi: "(Okay, so there's a broom in the corner, a feather duster on the wall, and cleaning rags on one of the shelves.)"

Emi: "(Hmm. . . what should I start with?)"
