# Something to drink
Emi: "(It's not too late yet. I think I'll grab a drink from the kitchen before heading to bed.)"

Emi: "(You can never go wrong with something cold right after a bath! Let's see what we've got here. . .)"

*I look through the shelves of the fridge, finding a jug of water, a milk bottle and a pitcher containing tea.*

Emi: "(Milk is definitely the classic choice to make, but the bottle is nearly empty. I kind of feel bad about leaving only a bit left.)"

Emi: "(Alternatively, tea might be pretty refreshing, but I'm not sure what kind of tea this is. It'd be nice if it was sweet, but I don't really want to drink it if it's unsweetened. . .)"

Emi: "(Considering that it's almost bedtime, I could just give my stomach a break and drink some water. It can't hurt to hydrate myself some more.)"
